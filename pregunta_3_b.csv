Looking back on previous practices, static parameters were the only options. Now, dynamic parameters indicating fluid responsiveness have become a significant part of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT). However, the efficacy of this approach has yet to be established in neurosurgery cases where patients are already on lot of diuretics, thus making fluid management more challenging. The present study aims to determine the efficacy of the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) with pulse pressure variation (PPV) in guiding GDFT in patients undergoing neurosurgery for supra-tentorial intracranial space occupying lesions (ICSOLs), in the form of a randomised controlled trial. After randomisation, the patients were categorised into either PVI or PPV groups. Both received a baseline 2 ml/kg/h Lactated Ringer's (RL) infusion. Additional fluid boluses consisted of 250 ml of colloid infused over a 10 min period if PVI was > 15% or PPV was > 13% for at least five minutes. The primary outcome was to determine the serum lactate difference between preoperative and postoperative values, which could fairly predict fluid deficit leading to inadequate perfusion. A total of 74 patients were analysed. Both PVI- and PPV-guided GDFT strategies showed no significant difference in the postoperative lactate values, with a P-value of 0.18. Similarly, the mean total fluid administered, mean blood loss, length of CCU stay, and emetic and hypotension episodes also showed no significant differences among the groups with P-values of 0.41, 0.78, 0.25, 0.30, and 0.67, respectively. For patients undergoing neurosurgery (supratentorial ICSOLs), PVI seems to guide GDFT comparably to PPV regarding tissue perfusion and postoperative complications. However, both the parameters had low sensitivity and specificity, with an area of curve of 0.577 for PPV and 0.423 for PVI, as far as GDFT was concerned.  © 2023 Pratyasa Nayak et al., published by sciendo.",fluid management; goal-directed fluid therapy; Pleth Variability Index; pulse pressure variation; supratentorial tumours,analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; diuretic agent; fentanyl; hemoglobin; phenylephrine; Ringer lactate solution; sevoflurane; thiopental; vecuronium; adult; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; area under the curve; arterial pressure; Article; bleeding; blood transfusion; body mass; brain surgery; brain tumor; controlled study; data analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; endotracheal intubation; erythrocyte; female; fluid therapy; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; human; hypotension; inotropism; intermittent positive pressure ventilation; lactate blood level; length of stay; major clinical study; male; neurosurgery; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; perioperative period; postoperative complication; prediction; pulse oximetry; pulse pressure; randomization; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; tidal volume; tissue perfusion; ultrasound; urine volume,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85170424033,"Here are the answers to your questions:

1. **What is pulse pressure variability?**

Pulse pressure variability (PPV) is a measure of the variation in pulse pressure over a specific time period, typically 10-20 minutes. It is a dynamic parameter that indicates the degree of cardiovascular instability and can be used to assess fluid responsiveness. PPV is calculated by measuring the variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) over time, and is usually expressed as a percentage.

2. **What are the normal limits?**

The normal limits of PPV vary depending on the population and the clinical context. In general, PPV is considered normal if it is less than 10-12%. In critically ill patients, PPV greater than 12-15% is often used as a threshold to indicate fluid responsiveness.

3. **What is the sensitivity and specificity to predict volume responsiveness?**

The sensitivity and specificity of PPV to predict volume responsiveness vary depending on the study and population. A meta-analysis published in the journal Critical Care found that the pooled sensitivity of PPV to predict volume responsiveness was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.89), and the pooled specificity was "

1. **What is pulse pressure variability?**
Pulse pressure variability (PPV) is a measure of the variability in systolic blood pressure (SBP) or pulse pressure over time. It is calculated by measuring the difference between the maximum and minimum SBP values during a given time period, usually 1-5 minutes. PPV is a non-invasive and easily measurable hemodynamic parameter that can be used to assess cardiac preload and predict fluid responsiveness.
2. **What are the normal limits?**
There is no universally accepted normal limit for PPV. However, a PPV value of 10-20% is generally considered to be within the normal range. Higher values (>20%) may indicate increased variability in cardiac output and suggest volume responsiveness, while lower values (<10%) may indicate decreased variability and suggest volume unresponsiveness.
3. **What is the sensitivity and specificity to predict volume responsiveness?**
Studies have shown that PPV has a moderate sensitivity (around 70-80%) and specificity (around 80-90%) in predicting volume responsiveness in patients undergoing surgery or in the intensive care unit. This means that PPV can detect volume responsiveness in most cases, but may"

The clinical importance of PEH has been advocated owing to its potential contribution to chronic BP lowering, and as a predictor of responders to exercise training as an antihypertensive therapy. However, the mechanisms underlying PEH have not been well defined. This study undertook a scoping review of research on PEH mechanisms, as disclosed in literature reviews. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and Sport Discus databases until January 2023 to locate 21 reviews - 13 narrative, four systematic with 102 primary trials, and four meta-analyses with 75 primary trials involving 1566 participants. We classified PEH mechanisms according to major physiological systems, as central (autonomic nervous system, baroreflex, cardiac) or peripheral (vascular, hemodynamic, humoral, and renal). In general, PEH has been related to changes in autonomic control leading to reduced cardiac output and/or sustained vasodilation. However, the role of autonomic control in eliciting PEH has been challenged in favor of local vasodilator factors. The contribution of secondary physiological outcomes to changes in cardiac output and/or vascular resistance during PEH remains unclear, especially by exercise modality and population (normal vs. elevated BP, young vs. older adults). Further research adopting integrated approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms of PEH is warranted, particularly when the magnitude and duration of BP reductions are clinically relevant.

1. **What is pulse pressure variability?**

Pulse pressure variability (PPV) is a measure of the variation in the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressures (systolic - diastolic) over a given time period. It is a non-invasive indicator of cardiovascular autonomic nervous system activity and has been used to assess cardiovascular risk, predict cardiac outcomes, and monitor treatment effects in various cardiovascular conditions.

2. **What are the normal limits?**

The normal limits of PPV are not well established, as it depends on the population being studied, the measurement technique, and the time frame considered. However, in general, PPV is considered low (<10-15%) in healthy individuals and increases with age, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.

3. **What is the sensitivity and specificity to predict volume responsiveness?**

PPV has been shown to have moderate to good sensitivity and specificity in predicting volume responsiveness in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. A meta-analysis of 15 studies found that PPV had a pooled sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 0.83 in predicting volume responsiveness. However, it is essential to note that the optimal cutoff value for PPV to predict volume responsiveness remains debated and"

Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed to measure the respiratory variability of aortic velocity-time integral (ΔVTI), respiratory variability of tricuspid annulus systolic peak velocity (ΔRVS), respiratory variability of mitral annulus systolic peak velocity (ΔLVS), and other related indicators. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a 10% increase in cardiac output after fluid expansion, assessed by TTE. Results: A total of 33 patients with septic shock were enrolled in this study. First, there was no significant difference in the population characteristics between the fluid responsiveness positive group (n = 17) and the fluid responsiveness negative group (n = 16) (P > 0.05). Second, Pearson correlation test showed that ΔRVS, ΔLVS, and TAPSE with the relative increase in cardiac output after fluid expansion (R = 0.55, P = 0.001; R = 0.40, P = 0.02; R = 0.36, P = 0.041). Third, multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ΔRVS, ΔLVS, and TAPSE were significantly correlated with fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock. Fourth, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that ΔVTI, ΔLVS, ΔRVS, and TAPSE had good predictive ability for fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock. The area under the curve (AUC) of ΔVTI, ΔLVS, ΔRVS, and TAPSE for predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.952, 0.802, 0.822, and 0.713, respectively. The sensitivity (Se) values were 1.00, 0.73, 0.81, and 0.83, whereas the specificity (Sp) values were 0.84, 0.91, 0.76, and 0.67, respectively. The optimal thresholds were 0.128, 0.129, 0.130, and 13.9 mm, respectively.

These interactions manifest as respiratory fluctuations in venous, pulmonary, and arterial pressures, potentially affecting stroke volume. In the context of functional hemodynamic monitoring, pulse or stroke volume variation (pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variability) are commonly employed to assess volume or preload responsiveness. However, correct interpretation of these parameters requires a comprehensive understanding of the physiological factors that determine pulse pressure and stroke volume. These factors include pleural pressure, venous return, pulmonary vessel function, lung mechanics, gas exchange, and specific cardiac factors. A comprehensive knowledge of heart-lung physiology is vital to avoid clinical misjudgments, particularly in cases of right ventricular (RV) failure or diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, when selecting monitoring devices or technologies, these factors must be considered. Invasive arterial pressure measurements of variations in breath-to-breath pressure swings are commonly used to monitor heart-lung interactions. Echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheters are valuable tools for differentiating preload responsiveness from right ventricular failure, while changes in diastolic function should be assessed alongside alterations in airway or pleural pressure, which can be approximated by esophageal pressure. In complex clinical scenarios like ARDS, combined forms of shock or right heart failure, additional information on gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics aids in the interpretation of heart-lung interactions. This review aims to describe monitoring techniques that provide clinicians with an integrative understanding of a patient’s condition, enabling accurate assessment and patient care.

**What is pulse pressure variability?**

Pulse pressure variability (PPV) is a measure of the change in pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) over a respiratory cycle. It is a non-invasive indicator of heart-lung interactions and is commonly used to assess volume responsiveness, which is the body's ability to increase cardiac output in response to a volume challenge.

**What are the normal limits?**

The normal limits of PPV vary depending on the population and the method of measurement. However, a commonly cited range is 10-20% of the mean pulse pressure. In healthy individuals, PPV is typically <10%. In patients with critical illness, PPV can be higher, often ranging from 20-40%.

**What is the sensitivity and specificity to predict volume responsiveness?**

The sensitivity and specificity of PPV to predict volume responsiveness vary depending on the population, the method of measurement, and the criteria used to define volume responsiveness. However, in general, PPV has been shown to have:

* Sensitivity: 70-90% (meaning that 70-90% of patients who respond to a volume challenge will have a PPV above a certain threshold)
