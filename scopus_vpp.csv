Looking back on previous practices, static parameters were the only options. Now, dynamic parameters indicating fluid responsiveness have become a significant part of goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT). However, the efficacy of this approach has yet to be established in neurosurgery cases where patients are already on lot of diuretics, thus making fluid management more challenging. The present study aims to determine the efficacy of the Pleth Variability Index (PVI) with pulse pressure variation (PPV) in guiding GDFT in patients undergoing neurosurgery for supra-tentorial intracranial space occupying lesions (ICSOLs), in the form of a randomised controlled trial. After randomisation, the patients were categorised into either PVI or PPV groups. Both received a baseline 2 ml/kg/h Lactated Ringer's (RL) infusion. Additional fluid boluses consisted of 250 ml of colloid infused over a 10 min period if PVI was > 15% or PPV was > 13% for at least five minutes. The primary outcome was to determine the serum lactate difference between preoperative and postoperative values, which could fairly predict fluid deficit leading to inadequate perfusion. A total of 74 patients were analysed. Both PVI- and PPV-guided GDFT strategies showed no significant difference in the postoperative lactate values, with a P-value of 0.18. Similarly, the mean total fluid administered, mean blood loss, length of CCU stay, and emetic and hypotension episodes also showed no significant differences among the groups with P-values of 0.41, 0.78, 0.25, 0.30, and 0.67, respectively. For patients undergoing neurosurgery (supratentorial ICSOLs), PVI seems to guide GDFT comparably to PPV regarding tissue perfusion and postoperative complications. However, both the parameters had low sensitivity and specificity, with an area of curve of 0.577 for PPV and 0.423 for PVI, as far as GDFT was concerned.  © 2023 Pratyasa Nayak et al., published by sciendo.","fluid management; goal-directed fluid therapy; Pleth Variability Index; pulse pressure variation; supratentorial tumours","analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; diuretic agent; fentanyl; hemoglobin; phenylephrine; Ringer lactate solution; sevoflurane; thiopental; vecuronium; adult; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; area under the curve; arterial pressure; Article; bleeding; blood transfusion; body mass; brain surgery; brain tumor; controlled study; data analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; endotracheal intubation; erythrocyte; female; fluid therapy; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; human; hypotension; inotropism; intermittent positive pressure ventilation; lactate blood level; length of stay; major clinical study; male; neurosurgery; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; perioperative period; postoperative complication; prediction; pulse oximetry; pulse pressure; randomization; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; tidal volume; tissue perfusion; ultrasound; urine volume","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170424033"

While many studies have shown that GDFT benefits patients perioperatively and can decrease postoperative complications, there is no consensus on which dynamic hemodynamic parameters to guide GDFT with. Furthermore, there are many commercialized hemodynamic monitoring systems to measure these dynamic hemodynamic parameters, and each has its pros and cons.

The clinical importance of PEH has been advocated owing to its potential contribution to chronic BP lowering, and as a predictor of responders to exercise training as an antihypertensive therapy. However, the mechanisms underlying PEH have not been well defined. This study undertook a scoping review of research on PEH mechanisms, as disclosed in literature reviews. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library, and Sport Discus databases until January 2023 to locate 21 reviews - 13 narrative, four systematic with 102 primary trials, and four meta-analyses with 75 primary trials involving 1566 participants. We classified PEH mechanisms according to major physiological systems, as central (autonomic nervous system, baroreflex, cardiac) or peripheral (vascular, hemodynamic, humoral, and renal). In general, PEH has been related to changes in autonomic control leading to reduced cardiac output and/or sustained vasodilation. However, the role of autonomic control in eliciting PEH has been challenged in favor of local vasodilator factors. The contribution of secondary physiological outcomes to changes in cardiac output and/or vascular resistance during PEH remains unclear, especially by exercise modality and population (normal vs. elevated BP, young vs. older adults). Further research adopting integrated approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms of PEH is warranted, particularly when the magnitude and duration of BP reductions are clinically relevant.

Methods: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed to measure the respiratory variability of aortic velocity-time integral (ΔVTI), respiratory variability of tricuspid annulus systolic peak velocity (ΔRVS), respiratory variability of mitral annulus systolic peak velocity (ΔLVS), and other related indicators. Fluid responsiveness was defined as a 10% increase in cardiac output after fluid expansion, assessed by TTE. Results: A total of 33 patients with septic shock were enrolled in this study. First, there was no significant difference in the population characteristics between the fluid responsiveness positive group (n = 17) and the fluid responsiveness negative group (n = 16) (P > 0.05). Second, Pearson correlation test showed that ΔRVS, ΔLVS, and TAPSE with the relative increase in cardiac output after fluid expansion (R = 0.55, P = 0.001; R = 0.40, P = 0.02; R = 0.36, P = 0.041). Third, multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ΔRVS, ΔLVS, and TAPSE were significantly correlated with fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock. Fourth, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that ΔVTI, ΔLVS, ΔRVS, and TAPSE had good predictive ability for fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock. The area under the curve (AUC) of ΔVTI, ΔLVS, ΔRVS, and TAPSE for predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.952, 0.802, 0.822, and 0.713, respectively. The sensitivity (Se) values were 1.00, 0.73, 0.81, and 0.83, whereas the specificity (Sp) values were 0.84, 0.91, 0.76, and 0.67, respectively. The optimal thresholds were 0.128, 0.129, 0.130, and 13.9 mm, respectively.

These interactions manifest as respiratory fluctuations in venous, pulmonary, and arterial pressures, potentially affecting stroke volume. In the context of functional hemodynamic monitoring, pulse or stroke volume variation (pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variability) are commonly employed to assess volume or preload responsiveness. However, correct interpretation of these parameters requires a comprehensive understanding of the physiological factors that determine pulse pressure and stroke volume. These factors include pleural pressure, venous return, pulmonary vessel function, lung mechanics, gas exchange, and specific cardiac factors. A comprehensive knowledge of heart-lung physiology is vital to avoid clinical misjudgments, particularly in cases of right ventricular (RV) failure or diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, when selecting monitoring devices or technologies, these factors must be considered. Invasive arterial pressure measurements of variations in breath-to-breath pressure swings are commonly used to monitor heart-lung interactions. Echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheters are valuable tools for differentiating preload responsiveness from right ventricular failure, while changes in diastolic function should be assessed alongside alterations in airway or pleural pressure, which can be approximated by esophageal pressure. In complex clinical scenarios like ARDS, combined forms of shock or right heart failure, additional information on gas exchange and pulmonary mechanics aids in the interpretation of heart-lung interactions. This review aims to describe monitoring techniques that provide clinicians with an integrative understanding of a patient’s condition, enabling accurate assessment and patient care.

Objective: to evaluate the HVR, endothelial function, and arterial stiffness changes during the first trimester of pregnancy and their relationship with the development of GH Methods: A group of women normotensive during the first trimester (n = 43), who later did (GH; n = 11) or did not (no-GH; n = 32) develop GH in that pregnancy, were enrolled. In the first trimester, endothelial function and arterial stiffness were evaluated through photoplethysmography. HRV, parasympathetic (PNS), and sympathetic (SNS) indexes were measured in a 5-minute continuous electrocardiogram record at rest sitting. The Griess reaction measured urinary nitrite excretion (NOx). Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) values were higher in GH (no-GH: 105.8 ± 2.0 vs. GH: 112.7 ± 3.0 mmHg; p < 0.05). Endothelial function was decreased, and arterial stiffness was increased in GH. Only in GH the arterial stiffness was correlated with SBP (Pearson's r: 0.5594; 95%CI: 0.06106–0.8681; p < 0.05). In HRV, GH decreased low-frequency power and the ratio SD2/SD1. The inhibition of PNS was lower in GH. The NOx was reduced in GH (no-GH: 3.4 ± 0.4 vs. GH: 0.3 ± 0.1 μM/L; p < 0.001). NOx was correlated negatively with the SNS index only in GH. Conclusions: Developed GH is preceded early in pregnancy by endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness.

We hypothesized that the beneficial effects of exercise training combined with antihypertensive drug therapy would be reduced after the chronic absence of arterial baroreceptor reflex. METHODS: Female spontaneously hypertensive rats (90 days old) were distributed (7-8 animals/group) into ovariectomized groups: trained treated with E (OTE) and SAD trained treated with E (SAD-OTE). SAD procedure was performed at initial of protocol. Ovariectomy consisted of bilateral removal of the ovaries. Enalapril (3mg/kg) was administrated orally in drinking water. CET (40-60% maximal capacity) consisted of aerobic (motor treadmill) followed by resistance exercises (ladder adapted to rats), 3 days/wk for 8 weeks. Heart rate and BP variability were analyzed using signals of direct recording of BP. Vasopressor system was evaluated by sequential injection of a vasopressin receptor antagonist, losartan and hexamethonium. RESULTS: Treadmill performance was reduced in SAD group (p<0.001). There were no differences for systolic, diastolic, and mean blood pressure (BP) between groups. SAD increased resting heart rate (p<0.001). In addition, SAD-OTE group showed lower variance of pulse interval (ms²) (49.2±22.5 vs. OTE: 96.5±49.6), as well as higher systolic BP variance (mmHg²) (84.1±36.9 vs. OTE: 34.2±9.0) and low-frequency band (mmHg²) (11.2±4.9 vs. OTE: 6.5±3.4). BP reduction (mmHg) after vasopressin receptor antagonist (-20.5±10.5) and hexamethonium (-87.2±17.7) was higher in SAD-OTE (vs. OTE: -6.9±4.6 and -56.0±10.4, respectively). CONCLUSION: Despite similar BP control, drug therapy-and training-induced adaptations are blunted in absence of baroreceptor deafferentation, suggesting that this mechanism play a crucial role to maintain physical and cardiovascular autonomic benefits. © FASEB.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138127485"

Reduced CSNA is associated with hemodynamic instability when patients are seated. Therefore, instantaneous measurements of CSNA are import-ant in seated patients presenting with Horner’s syndrome. However, there are no effective tools to measure real-time CSNA intraoperatively. To evaluate the usefulness of pupillom-etry in measuring CSNA, we investigated the relationship between pupil size and CSNA. Methods: Forty-two patients undergoing right arthroscopic shoulder surgery under ISB-PB were analyzed. Pupil diameters were measured at 30 Hz for 2 s using a portable pupil-lometer. Bilateral pupil diameters and CSNA (natural-log-transformed low-frequency power [0.04–0.15 Hz] of heart rate variability [lnLF]) were measured before ISBPB (pre-ISBPB) and 15 min after transition to the sitting position following ISBPB (post-sit-ting). Changes in the pupil diameter ([right pupil diameter for post-sitting – left pupil diameter for post-sitting] – [right pupil diameter for pre-ISBPB – left pupil diameter for pre-ISBPB]) and CSNA (lnLF for post-sitting – lnLF for pre-ISBPB) were calculated. Results: Forty-one patients (97.6%) developed Horner’s syndrome. Right pupil diameter and lnLF significantly decreased upon transition to sitting after ISBPB. In the linear regression model (R2 = 0.242, P = 0.001), a one-unit decrease (1 mm) in the extent of changes in the pupil diameter reduced the extent of changes in lnLF by 0.659 ln(ms2 /Hz) (95% CI [0.090, 1.228]). Conclusions: Pupillometry is a useful tool to measure changes in CSNA after the transition to sitting following ISBPB. © 2023, Korean Society of Anesthesiologists.

Although advanced hemodynamic monitoring (including arterial pulse wave analysis [PWA]) is of recent interest, the validity of PWA-derived indices in burn resuscitation extremes has not been established. The goal of this paper is to test the hypothesis that PWA-derived cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) indices as well as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV) can play a complementary role to UOP in burn resuscitation. Swine were instrumented with a Swan-Ganz catheter for reference CO and underwent a 40% TBSA burns with varying resuscitation paradigms, and were monitored for 24 hours in an ICU setting under mechanical ventilation. The longitudinal changes in PWA-derived indices were investigated, and resuscitation adequacy was compared as determined by UOP vs PWA indices. The results indicated that PWA-derived indices exhibited trends consistent with reference CO and SV measurements: CO and SV indices were proportional to reference CO and SV, respectively (CO: postcalibration limits of agreement [LoA] = ±24.7 [ml/min/kg], SV: postcalibration LoA = ±0.30 [ml/kg]) while PPV and SPV were inversely proportional to reference SV (PPV: postcalibration LoA = ±0.32 [ml/kg], SPV: postcalibration LoA = ±0.31 [ml/kg]). The results also indicated that PWA-derived indices exhibited notable discrepancies from UOP in determining adequate burn resuscitation. Hence, it was concluded that the PWA-derived indices may have complementary value to UOP in assessing and guiding burn resuscitation. © 2022 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Burn Association.","","Animals; Arteries; Blood Pressure; Burns; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Pulse Wave Analysis; Respiration, Artificial; Resuscitation; Swine; fentanyl; ketamine; propofol; Ringer lactate solution; sulfadiazine silver; vecuronium; xylazine; animal experiment; animal model; Article; artificial ventilation; blood pressure variability; burn; controlled study; fluid resuscitation; heart output; heart stroke volume; in vivo study; nonhuman; pulse pressure; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; urine volume; animal; artery; blood pressure; burn; fluid therapy; hemodynamics; pig; procedures; pulse wave; resuscitation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159543608"

However, there is little knowledge of adolescent MDD. We aimed to study complex cardiovascular autonomic regulation and early atherosclerotic damage with a focus on an analysis of heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), systolic time intervals, and measures of early atherosclerotic changes in adolescent MDD. Ninety depressive adolescents (34 boys, age 15.8 ± 1.3 yrs.) and 90 age-/gender-matched controls were examined. Evaluated parameters: HRV – time and spectral parameters, BPV – mean, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure, spectral systolic parameters; haemodynamic indices – stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, systolic time intervals – left ventricular ejection time, pre-ejection period; atherosclerotic indices – ankle-brachial index (ABI), pulse wave velocity, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, cardio-ankle vascular index; growth factors – epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor associated with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Our results showed that the MDD group had significantly reduced HRV and higher BPV measures, shortened systolic time intervals, lower ABI, and higher EGF compared to controls. Concluding, our study revealed that adolescent MDD is associated with cardiovascular dysregulation and early vasculature dysfunction as preclinical markers of higher risk for cardiovascular morbidity, thus adolescence seems to represent an important age period for early diagnosis and prevention of later MDD-linked cardiovascular diseases manifesting in adulthood. © 2022","Adolescent major depression; Blood pressure variability; Cardiovascular autonomic regulation; Cardiovascular risk; Heart rate variability; Preclinical atherosclerosis","Adolescent; Adult; Ankle Brachial Index; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Chemokine CCL2; Depressive Disorder, Major; Epidermal Growth Factor; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; epidermal growth factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; vasculotropin; epidermal growth factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; vasculotropin A; adolescent; adolescent depression; ankle brachial index; Article; atherosclerosis; autonomic dysfunction; blood pressure variability; brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity; cardio-ankle vascular index; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart left ventricle ejection time; heart output; heart rate variability; heart stroke volume; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; mean arterial pressure; non invasive procedure; pre-ejection period; pulse wave velocity; systolic blood pressure; systolic time interval; vascular resistance; vascularization; adult; blood pressure; heart rate; physiology; pulse wave","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136603903"

Although exercise is an important intervention for cardiovascular promotion, it is unclear whether combat sports training could benefit cardiovascular outcomes as much as autonomic in this population. This study compared the effects of 12 weeks of Muay Thai (MT) training against functional training (FT) on CAM and hemodynamic parameters in older adults. Methods: The sample consisted of 50 older adults (41 women; 66.0 ± 5.3 years old), who were equaly randomized into FT (n = 25) and MT (n = 25) intervention groups. CAM was measured by 30-min rest heart rate variability. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and resting heart rate (RHR) were measured using an automatic oscillometric device. Pulse pressure (PP) and the double product (DP) were also calculated. The interventions were carried out three times a week, with 60-min length per session, during 12 consecutive weeks. The intensity of the interventions was measured using the subjective perception of exertion scale and by accelerometer. Two-factor repeated measures analysis of covariance was used for groups comparison, considering intervention group and body mass as factors. The 95% confidence interval of the difference (95%CIdif) was also calculated and the effect size was measured using partial eta squared (η2p). Results: CAM indices did not show significant changes across moments and intervention groups. In hemodynamic parameters, only in DBP was there an effect of the moment (F1,39 = 8.206; P = 0.007; η2p = 0.174, large) and interaction effect between group*moment (F1,39 = 7.950; P = 0.008; η2p = 0.169, large). Specifically, the MT group at the post-training moment showed lower DBP (P = 0.010; 95%CIdif = -13.3; -1.89) in relation to the FT group. Furthermore, the MT group showed a decrease in DBP during training (P = 0.002; 95%CIdif = -10.3; -2.6). Also, an increase in training intensity was also found over the 12 weeks in FT, with no difference between the groups. Conclusion: After 12 weeks of MT practice there was a reduction in DBP compared to FT in older adults.

Virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) promotes acute hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions similar to traditional rehabilitation and can increase patient adherence to the program. However, it is unknown whether the combination of VRBT to a traditional CR manages to maintain or even improve clinical and autonomic variables in long term. Objective: To analyze whether VRBT combination in a traditional CR can maintain or improve clinical and autonomic variables in cardiac patients in the maintenance phase of these programs. Methods: Twenty-six volunteers (62.04 ± 12.22 years) were evaluated, who underwent an initial assessment and two other assessments (in the sixth and 12th week) of the following outcomes: systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse saturation of oxygen, heart rate, perceived exertion, and cardiac autonomic modulation, using linear and non-linear heart rate variability methods. Results: Except for the apparent lack of clinical significance observed in Shannon Entropy, LF (nu), and HF (nu), the combination of VRBT as routine in a traditional program did not cause significant changes in the analyzed variables. Conclusion: combination of VRBT was able to maintain the chronic hemodynamic and autonomic repercussions caused by traditional CR. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","autonomic nervous system; Cardiac rehabilitation; cardiovascular diseases; exercise; virtual reality exposure therapy","Blood Pressure; Cardiac Rehabilitation; Heart Rate; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Virtual Reality; blood pressure; heart rate; heart rehabilitation; human; longitudinal study; physiology; procedures; virtual reality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145300115"

On this basis, a protocol for taNS with autonomic modulatory potential could be proposed. Subjects and methods: We included 26 men and 24 women, mean age 26. Data were collected during three randomly allocated 20-minute right tragus stimulation sessions – a) no-stimulation (sham), b) 90 µA (arbitrary), and c) 130 µA (near the lowest sensory threshold in majority). Stimulation was 20 Hz, rectangular pulse width of 2 ms, duty cycle 2-second on/off. To assess autonomic responses, we continuously recorded ECG, non-invasive arterial blood pressure (BP) and thoracic impedance cardiography data. Ten-minute data were compared. Fast Fourier transform of RR intervals was performed on 10-minute recordings as well. Low frequency and high frequency power spectra were calculated. Friedman test or one-way ANOVA for repeated measurements and Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, or t-test were carried out. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: At 130 µA stimulation, cardiac output significantly decreased (p < 0.05), driven by significant heart rate drop in women, and stroke volume and contractility drop in men, pointing to a gender-related autonomic responses. We observed no significant changes in BP, or variability parameters. Significantly higher body size and BP were found in men, as expected. Conclusions: It seems that tested taNS protocol has a potential for cardiac autonomic modulation in majority of young healthy men as well as women. Further studies are however needed to prove the therapeutic potential of this stimulation protocol in different patient groups. © 2023","Cardiovascular system; Neuromodulation; Transcutaneous; Vagus nerve stimulation","adult; analysis of variance; arterial pressure; article; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure variability; body size; cardiovascular system; clinical article; controlled study; electrocardiogram; electrocardiography; female; Fourier transform; Friedman test; gender; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamics; human; impedance cardiography; male; muscle contractility; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; perceptive threshold; randomized controlled trial; RR interval; vagus nerve stimulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147539593"

An understanding of basic hemodynamic principles is necessary to utilize each in the appropriate setting. Cardiac output relies on synchrony between the arterial and venous systems. The arterial system can be visualized as a series of high resistance circuits with the aorta and major arteries serving as high capacitance vascular regions. Preload and afterload are factors that are influenced by the Diastolic Pressure-Volume curve, Mean Systemic Filling Pressure, and Venous return. Dynamic methods of effective arterial volume assessment have proven to be more effective than static methods because they take respirophasic changes into account. Some of these methods, particularly bedside echocardiography, have higher inter-operator variability than lung ultrasound. In the Neuro-Science Intensive Care Unit, lung ultrasound is a very effective tool that can be used in both mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients to help guide fluid administration. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Hemodynamic monitoring; Hemodynamic principles; Lung ultrasound; Pulse contour analysis","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152810235"

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic importance of 24 h BP, BP variability, and arterial stiffness in a cohort of very elderly patients admitted to the hospital due to a decompensated chronic disease. We studied 249 patients older than 80 (66% women; 60% congestive heart failure). Noninvasive 24 h monitoring was used to determine 24 h brachial and central BP, BP and heart rate variabilities, aortic pulse wave velocity, and BP variability ratios during admission. The primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Aortic pulse wave velocity (3.3 times for each SD increase) and BP variability ratio (31% for each SD increase) were associated with 1-year mortality, after adjustments for clinical confounders. Increased systolic BP variability (38% increase for each SD change) and reduced heart rate variability (32% increase for each SD change) also predicted 1-year mortality. In conclusion, increased aortic stiffness and BP and heart rate variabilities predict 1-year mortality in very elderly patients with decompensated chronic conditions. Measurements of such estimates could be useful in the prognostic evaluation of this specific population. © 2023 by the authors.","arterial stiffness; blood pressure variability; decompensated chronic conditions; mortality; pulse wave velocity; very old population","beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; aged; aortic pulse wave velocity; arterial stiffness; Article; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure variability; brachial pressure; chronic disease; cohort analysis; congestive heart failure; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; non invasive procedure; outcome assessment; prognosis; prospective study; pulse wave velocity; systolic blood pressure; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148939559"

In this study perfusion index (PI) and plethysmographic variability index (PVI) changes were used to evaluate in blocks success. The PVI and PI values were detected by a Radical-7TM finger pulse oximetry device (Massimo Corp, USA) in both fingers of 50 plastic surgery patients, who received an axillary brachial plexus catheter before surgery. Data recorded at baseline, during catheter replacement, after catheter replacement, and before surgery. All periods hemodynamic data, visual analog scala, Ramsey sedation score and patient satisfaction score were collected. In all 110 patients blocks were successfully applied, PI values in blocked arm increased after local analgesic application (during catheter replacement), (P < .05), PVI values were decreased in the same period but there were no statistical significance. The PI increases after peripheral plexus blockade and may be used as an indicator for successful block placement in awake patient.

The problem of raising blood pressure in athletes is still relevant, given the high prevalence of latent hemodynamic disorders and conditions such as overtraining and autonomic dysfunction. Outpatient monitoring of blood pressure allows to supplement the clinical picture in athletes with autonomic dysfunction to identify hidden hemodynamic disorders of athletes with pre-pathological conditions, including chronic stress, overtraining, and prehypertension. Materials and Methods. The study included 30 healthy athletes who were divided into two groups depending on the presence of higher normal blood pressure. The groups were matched for age, gender, and duration of sports history. Blood pressure measurements were performed in the office by the oscillometric method using appropriate cuff size, depending on the shoulder circumference, and according to the standardized protocol for measuring blood pressure in the office and by outpatient monitoring. Surveys were conducted in the preparatory period of the annual training macrocycle in compliance with the requirements of bioethics. Results. We found that athletes with higher normal blood pressure had more common symptoms that impaired quality of life and physical performance: feeling tired after training, dissatisfaction with the training task, reduced tolerance to temperature changes; this group of athletes had a significantly higher index of autonomic dysfunction (p ˂ 0.05). Daily monitoring of blood pressure revealed five people (33%) with latent (""masked"") hypertension in the group of higher normal blood pressure vs. 0 people in the group of optimal blood pressure. The higher normal blood pressure group was characterized by the predominance of the weighted average day, night, daily systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean blood pressure. The average pulse pressure during the day in both groups was identical; however, at night, the decrease in pulse pressure average values was not significant in the higher normal blood pressure group in contrast to the group of normal optimal blood pressure, due to which the difference for this indicator between the two groups reached statistical significance. In addition, the night time in the group of higher normal blood pressure was characterized by a decrease in heart rate variability with a decrease in Circadian Heart Rate Index; a much smaller number of people had a Deeper profile of blood pressure, while a third of participants belonged to the Non-Deeper category; one athlete showed an increase in blood pressure at night. The inverse relationship was established concerning the level of the maximum rise of systolic blood pressure at night and the percentage decrease in nocturnal systolic blood pressure. In our opinion, all this suggests the excessive activity of sympathetic influences in athletes with office higher normal blood pressure due to excessive physical activity. Conclusion. One-third of athletes with higher normal office blood pressure was found to have hidden (""masked"") hypertension. Given the period of training of athletes, history, and blood pressure profile, the assumption can be made about the importance of dysfunctional fatigue in the development of changes in hemodynamics. Further studies are needed to study the dynamics of blood circulation in the correction of training load in people with signs of overtraining and autonomic dysfunction. © 2022 by the author.","blood pressure; latent hypertension; office prehypertension; the preparatory period of the annual macrocycle","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85176405743"

A further aim was to draw attention to the fact that some hemodynamic changes after COVID-19 may cause long-term health problems. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 174 adult individuals who had had COVID-19 and were currently living a normal life and 56 healthy individuals with similar demographic characteristics who had not had COVID-19 were included in the study. The PI, PVI, oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate (PR), total hemoglobin (Hgb), oxygen reserve index (ORI), and blood pressure values were measured by Masimo Radical 7. The data of individuals who had and did not have COVID-19 before were compared. RESULTS: The mean PVI (p = 0.008) and PI (p < 0.001) were significantly lower in people who had been exposed to COVID-19. Likewise, the mean of ORI, SpO2, and SpOC values was observed to be significantly lower in participants exposed to COVID-19 disease (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p = 0.006, respectively). The PVI had a positive correlation with body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.263, p < 0.001) and a negative correlation with SpO2 (r = -0.194, p = 0.003) and PR (r = 0.190, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: The PVI, PI, and other physiological parameters could potentially be useful for monitoring COVID-19 patients and evaluating their response to therapy. We believe that people who have been exposed to COVID-19 may be more susceptible to other diseases; therefore, they should be subjected to regular clinical checks.","","Adult; Blood Pressure; COVID-19; Hemodynamics; Humans; Oximetry; Oxygen; Perfusion Index; oxygen; adult; blood pressure; coronavirus disease 2019; hemodynamics; human; oximetry; perfusion index; physiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178519160"

To address these challenges, we developed a unique approach by creating a novel intra-beat biomarker (Diastolic Transit Time, DTT) to achieve highly accurate blood pressure (BP) estimations. We demonstrated our approach’s superior performance, compared to other common signal processing techniques, in eliminating stochastic baseline wander, while maintaining signal integrity and measurement accuracy, even during significant hemodynamic changes. We applied this new algorithm to BP data collected using non-invasive sensors from a diverse cohort of high acuity patients and demonstrated that we could achieve close agreement with the gold standard invasive arterial line BP measurements, for up to 20 min without recalibration. We established our approach's generalizability by successfully applying it to pulse waveforms obtained from various sensors, including photoplethysmography and capacitive-based pressure sensors. Our algorithm also maintained signal integrity, enabling reliable assessments of BP variability. Moreover, our algorithm demonstrated tolerance to both low- and high-frequency motion artifacts during abrupt hand movements and prolonged periods of walking. Thus, our approach shows promise in constituting a necessary advance and can be applied to a wide range of wearable sensors for CNIBP monitoring in the ambulatory and inpatient settings. © 2022, The Author(s).","","Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Heart Rate; Humans; Photoplethysmography; biological marker; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; heart rate; human; photoelectric plethysmography; physiology; procedures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139333182"

Pulse wave contour analysis has previously been used to infer hemodynamic variables in a variety of settings. We hypothesized that pulse arrival time (PAT), a form of pulse wave contour analysis which is assessed via electrocardiography (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG), is associated with hemorrhage volume. Methods: Yorkshire-Cross swine were randomized to hemorrhage (30 mL/kg over 20 minutes) vs. control. Continuous ECG and PPG waveforms were recorded with a novel monitoring device, and algorithms were developed to calculate PAT and PAT variability throughout the respiratory cycle, termed “PAT index” or “PAT_I.” Mixed effects models were used to determine associations between blood loss and PAT and between blood loss and PAT_I to account for clustering within subjects and investigate inter-subject variability in these relationships. Results: PAT and PAT_I data were determined for ∼150 distinct intervals from five subjects. PAT and PAT_I were strongly associated with blood loss. Mixed effects modeling with PAT alone was substantially better than PAT_I alone (R2 0.93 vs. 0.57 and Akaike information criterion (AIC) 421.1 vs. 475.5, respectively). Modeling blood loss with PAT and PAT_I together resulted in slightly improved fit compared to PAT alone (R2 0.96, AIC 419.1). Mixed effects models demonstrated significant inter-subject variability in the relationships between blood loss and PAT. Conclusions: Findings from this pilot study suggest that PAT and PAT_I may be used to detect blood loss. Because of the simple design of a single-lead ECG and PPG, the technology could be packaged into a very small form factor device for use in austere or resource-constrained environments. Significant inter-subject variability in the relationship between blood loss and PAT highlights the importance of individualized hemodynamic monitoring. © 2022 Oxford University Press.

Hypertension is a significant risk factor for this so far untreatable irreversible condition. The attention of researchers is now focused on identifying individuals at increased risk of cognitive decline or with early-stage cognitive deficit. Apart from cognitive function tests and imaging studies, no suitable biomarkers to identify these individuals have been available as yet. Haemodynamic parameters could be potentially useful biomarkers. At the ESH 2022 Congress, Professor Cunha presented the current knowledge suggesting that cognitive decline could be related to visit-to-visit blood pressure variability, carotid artery intima media thickness, and aortic stiffness as measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV). Currently, the CEREBRO study is being conducted to evaluate the prevalence of cognitive dysfunction in patients with hypertension and to search for early vascular biomarkers that correlate with cognitive decline. In addition to early and tight control of blood pressure, early detection of cognitive impairment could be a way to reduce the prevalence of advanced stages of dementia in the future. © 2023, SOLEN s.r.o.

We aimed to evaluate the effect of fluid preloading in the supine position, the subsequent hemodynamic changes in the prone position and postoperative outcomes. Patients and methods: This prospective, assessor-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted between March and June 2023. Adults scheduled for elective orthopaedic lumbar surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled. In total, 80 participants were randomly assigned to fluid maintenance (M) or loading (L) groups. Both groups were administered intravenous fluid at a rate of 2 ml/kg/h until surgical incision; Group L was loaded with an additional 5 ml/kg intravenous fluid for 10 min after anaesthesia induction. The primary outcome was incidence of hypotension before surgical incision. Secondary outcomes included differences in the mean blood pressure (mBP), heart rate, pleth variability index (PVi), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume index and cardiac index before surgical incision between the two groups. Additionally, postoperative complications until postoperative day 2 and postoperative hospital length of stay were investigated. Results: Hypotension was prevalent in Group M before surgical incision and could be predicted by a baseline PVi >16. The mBP was significantly higher in Group L immediately after fluid loading. The PVi, SVV and PPV were lower in Group L after fluid loading, with continued differences at 2–3 time points for SVV and PPV. Other outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion: Fluid loading after inducing general anaesthesia could reduce the occurrence of hypotension until surgical incision in patients scheduled for surgery in the prone position. Additionally, hypotension could be predicted in patients with a baseline PVi >16. Therefore, intravenous fluid loading is strongly recommended in patients with high baseline PVi to prevent hypotension after anaesthesia induction and in the prone position.

The potential association between the changes in these parameters and arterial stiffness in hypertension remains poorly understood. This systematic review aims to investigate the association between non-invasive indicators of autonomic function based on beat-to-beat cardiovascular signals with arterial stiffness in individuals with hypertension. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2022. Studies that investigated non-invasive parameters of arterial stiffness and autonomic function using beat-to-beat cardiovascular signals over a period of > 5min were included. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE criteria. Two authors screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts independently. Results: Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. A comprehensive overview of experimental design for assessing autonomic function in terms of baroreflex sensitivity and beat-to-beat cardiovascular variabilities, as well as arterial stiffness, was presented. Alterations in non-invasive indicators of autonomic function, which included baroreflex sensitivity, beat-to-beat cardiovascular variabilities and hemodynamic changes in response to autonomic challenges, as well as arterial stiffness, were identified in individuals with hypertension. A mixed result was found in terms of the association between non-invasive quantitative autonomic indices and arterial stiffness in hypertensive individuals. Nine out of 12 studies which quantified baroreflex sensitivity revealed a significant association with arterial stiffness parameters. Three studies estimated beat-to-beat heart rate variability and only one study reported a significant relationship with arterial stiffness indices. Three out of five studies which studied beat-to-beat blood pressure variability showed a significant association with arterial structural changes. One study revealed that hemodynamic changes in response to autonomic challenges were significantly correlated with arterial stiffness parameters. Conclusions: The current review demonstrated alteration in autonomic function, which encompasses both the sympathetic and parasympathetic modulation of sinus node function and vasomotor tone (derived from beat-to-beat cardiovascular signals) in hypertension, and a significant association between some of these parameters with arterial stiffness. By employing non-invasive measurements to monitor changes in autonomic function and arterial remodeling in individuals with hypertension, we would be able to enhance our ability to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Understanding the intricate relationships among these cardiovascular variability measures and arterial stiffness could contribute toward better individualized treatment for hypertension in the future.

In addition, since the arterial baroreflex plays a critical role in beat-to-beat BP regulation, we further hypothesized that an impaired baroreflex control would be associated with an augmented resting beat-to-beat BPV. Methods: In 25 sedentary patients with CKD stages III–IV (62 ± 9 years) and 20 controls (57 ± 10 years), resting beat-to-beat BP (finger photoplethysmography) and heart rate (electrocardiography) were continuously measured for 10 min. We calculated the standard deviation (SD), average real variability (ARV) and other indices of BPV. The sequence technique was used to estimate spontaneous cardiac baroreflex sensitivity. Results: Compared with controls (CON), the CKD group had significantly increased resting BPV. The ARV (2.2 ± 0.6 versus 1.6 ± 0.5 mmHg, P < 0.001; 1.6 ± 0.7 versus 1.3 ± 0.3 mmHg, P = 0.039; 1.4 ± 0.5 versus 1.0 ± 0.2 mmHg, P < 0.001) of systolic, diastolic and mean BP, respectively, was increased in CKD versus controls. Other traditional measures of variability showed similar results. The cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was lower in CKD compared with controls (CKD: 8.4 ± 4.5 ms/mmHg versus CON: 14.0 ± 8.2 ms/mmHg, P = 0.008). In addition, cardiac baroreflex sensitivity was negatively associated with BPV [systolic blood pressure (SBP) ARV; r = −0.44, P = 0.003]. Conclusion: In summary, our data demonstrate that patients with CKD have augmented beat-to-beat BPV and lower cardiac baroreflex sensitivity. BPV and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity were negatively correlated in this cohort.

However, different studies have shown that PRV does not always replicate HRV as there are multiple factors that could affect their relationship, such as respiration and pulse transit time. In this study, an in-vitro model was developed for the simulation of the upper-circulatory system, and PPG signals were acquired from it when haemodynamic changes were induced. PRV was obtained from these signals and time-domain, frequency-domain and non-linear indices were extracted. Factorial analyses were performed to understand the effects of changing blood pressure and flow on PRV indices in the absence of HRV. Results showed that PRV indices are affected by these haemodynamic changes and that these may explain some of the differences between HRV and PRV. Future studies should aim to replicate these results in healthy volunteers and patients, as well as to include the HRV information in the in-vitro model for a more profound understanding of these differences. © 2022 by the authors.","haemodynamics; in-vitro cardiovascular models; photoplethysmography; pulse rate variability; vascular tissue phantoms","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136510472"

Evidence for the effects of prone position in pregnancy is less clear. This study aimed to determine the effect maternal prone position on maternal haemodynamics and fetal heart rate, compared with left lateral position. Methods Twenty-one women >28 weeks’ gestation underwent non-invasive CO monitoring (Cheetah) every 5 minutes and continuous fetal heart rate monitoring (MONICA) in left lateral (20 minutes), prone (30 minutes), followed by left lateral (20 minutes). Anxiety and comfort were assessed by questionnaires. Regression analyses (adjusted for time) compared variables between positions. The information derived from the primary study was used in an existing mathematical model of maternal circulation in pregnancy, to determine whether occlusion of the inferior vena cava could account for the observed effects. In addition, a scoping review was performed to identify reported clinical, haemodynamic and fetal effects of maternal prone position; studies were included if they reported clinical outcomes or effects or maternal prone position in pregnancy. Study records were grouped by publication type for ease of data synthesis and critical analysis. Meta-analysis was performed where there were sufficient studies. Results Maternal blood pressure (BP) and total vascular resistance (TVR) were increased in prone (sBP 109 vs 104 mmHg, p = 0.03; dBP 74 vs 67 mmHg, p = 0.003; TVR 1302 vs 1075 dyne. s-1cm-5, p = 0.03). CO was reduced in prone (5.7 vs 7.1 mL/minute, p = 0.003). Fetal heart rate, variability and decelerations were unaltered. However, fetal accelerations were less common in prone position (86% vs 95%, p = 0.03). Anxiety was reduced after the procedure, compared to beforehand (p = 0.002), despite a marginal decline in comfort (p = 0.04).The model predicted that if occlusion of the inferior vena cava occurred, the sBP, dBP and CO would generally decrease. However, the TVR remained relatively consistent, which implies that the MAP and CO decrease at a similar rate when occlusion occurs. The scoping review found that maternal and fetal outcomes from 47 included case reports of prone positioning during pregnancy were generally favourable. Meta-analysis of three prospective studies investigating maternal haemodynamic effects of prone position found an increase in sBP and maternal heart rate, but no effect on respiratory rate, oxygen saturation or baseline fetal heart rate (though there was significant heterogeneity between studies). Conclusion Prone position was associated with a reduction in CO but an uncertain effect on fetal wellbeing. The decline in CO may be due to caval compression, as supported by the computational model. Further work is needed to optimise the safety of prone positioning in pregnancy. Trial registration: This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04586283). © 2023 Public Library of Science.

Elastic properties of coronary vessels produce a significant effect on the accuracy of simulations. Direct measurements of the elasticity of coronary vessels are not available in the general clinic. Pulse wave velocity (AoPWV) in the aorta correlates with aortic and coronary elasticity. In this work, we present a neural network approach for estimating AoPWV. Because of the limited number of clinical cases, we used a synthetic AoPWV database of virtual subjects to train the network. We use an additional set of AoPWV data collected from real patients to test the developed algorithm. The developed neural network predicts brachial–ankle AoPWV with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of (Formula presented.) m/s and a percentage error of (Formula presented.). We demonstrate the relevance of a new technique by comparing invasively measured fractional flow reserve (FFR) with simulated values using the patient data with constant ((Formula presented.) m/s) and predicted AoPWV. We conclude that patient-specific identification of AoPWV via the developed neural network improves the estimation of FFR from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) on average, with a maximum difference of (Formula presented.) in a particular case. Furthermore, we also numerically investigate the sensitivity of the most useful hemodynamic indices, including FFR, coronary flow reserve (CFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) to AoPWV using the patient-specific data. We observe a substantial variability of all considered indices for AoPWV below 10 m/s and weak variation of AoPWV above 15 m/s. We conclude that the hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis is higher for the patients with AoPWV in the range from 10 to 15 m/s. The advantages of our approach are the use of a limited set of easily measured input parameters (age, stroke volume, heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures) and the usage of a model-generated (synthetic) dataset to train and test machine learning methods for predicting hemodynamic indices. The application of our approach in clinical practice saves time, workforce and funds. © 2023 by the authors.","coronary circulation; fractional flow reserve; instantaneous wave-free ratio; machine learning; neural network; one-dimensional hemodynamics; pulse wave; stenosis; synthetic population","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151336051"

Methods Intra-arterial pressures (IAP) during VT were collected in patients admitted for VT ablation and correlated to clinical, ECG and baseline echocardiographical parameters. Results 114 VTs from 58 patients were included (median 67 years old, 81% ischemic heart disease, median left ventricular ejection fraction 30%). 61 VTs were untolerated needing immediate termination (54%). VT tolerance was tightly linked to the evolution of IAPs. Faster VT rates (p<0.0001), presence of resynchronization therapy (p = 0.008), previous anterior myocardial infarction (p = 0.009) and more marginally larger baseline QRS duration (p = 0.1) were independently associated with VT tolerance. Only an inferior myocardial infarction was more often present in patients with only tolerated VTs vs patients with only untolerated VTs in multivariate analysis (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.4-1000, p = 0.03). In patients with both well-tolerated and untolerated VTs, a higher VT rate was the only variable independently associated with untolerated VT (p = 0.02). Two different patterns of hemodynamic profiles during VT could be observed: a regular 1:1 relationship between electrical (QRS) and mechanical (IAP) events or some dissociation between both. VT with the second pattern were more often untolerated compared to the first pattern (78% vs 29%, p<0.0001). Conclusion This study helps to explain the large variability in clinical tolerance during VT, which is clearly related to IAP.

Capnodynamic and established hemodynamic monitoring parameters' capability to depict alterations in blood volume were investigated in a model of standardized hemorrhage, followed by crystalloid and blood transfusion. Methods: Ten anesthetized piglets were subjected to controlled hemorrhage (450 mL), followed by isovolemic crystalloid bolus and blood re-transfusion. Intravascular blood volume, and all hemodynamic variables, were determined twice after each intervention. The investigated hemodynamic variables were: cardiac output and stroke volume for capnodynamics and pulse contour analysis, respectively, pulse pressure and stroke volume variability and mean arterial pressure. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test for multiple comparisons were used to identify significant changes. Trending was assessed by correlation and concordance. Result: Concordance against intravascular volume changes for capnodynamic cardiac output and stroke volume were 96 and 94%, with correlations r =.78 and.68, (p <.0001) with significant changes for 6 and 5 of the 6 measuring points, respectively. Mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure variation had a concordance of 85% and 87%, r =.67 (p <.0001) and r = −.45 (p <.0001), respectively, and both changed significantly for 3 of 6 measuring points.

The present study aims to expand current knowledge through a beat-to-beat analysis of non-invasive finger photoplethysmography (PPG) in AF patients restoring sinus rhythm by electrical cardioversion (ECV). Continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure and left middle finger PPG pulse oximetry waveform (POW) signals were continuously recorded before and after elective ECV of consecutive AF or atrial flutter (AFL) patients. The main metrics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation), as well as a beat-to-beat analysis of the pulse pressure (PP) and POW beat-averaged value (aPOW), were computed to compare pre- and post-ECV phases. 53 patients (mean age 69 ± 8 years, 79% males) were enrolled; cardioversion was successful in restoring SR in 51 (96%) and signal post-processing was feasible in 46 (87%) patients. In front of a non-significant difference in mean PP (pre-ECV: 51.96 ± 13.25, post-ECV: 49.58 ± 10.41 mmHg; p = 0.45), mean aPOW significantly increased after SR restoration (pre-ECV: 0.39 ± 0.09, post-ECV: 0.44 ± 0.06 a.u.; p < 0.001). Moreover, at beat-to-beat analysis linear regression yielded significantly different slope (m) for the PP (RR) relationship compared to aPOW(RR) [PP(RR): 0.43 ± 0.18; aPOW(RR): 1.06 ± 0.17; p < 0.001]. Long (> 95th percentile) and short (< 5th percentile) RR intervals were significantly more irregular in the pre-ECV phases for both PP and aPOW; however, aPOW signal suffered more fluctuations compared to PP (p < 0.001 in both phases). Present findings suggest that AF-related hemodynamic alterations are more manifest at the peripheral (aPOW) rather than at the upstream macrocirculatory level (PP). Restoring sinus rhythm increases mean peripheral microvascular perfusion and decreases variability of the microvascular hemodynamic signals. Future dedicated studies are required to determine if AF-induced peripheral microvascular alterations might relate to long-term prognostic effects. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Atrial Flutter; Electric Countershock; Female; Humans; Male; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Photoplethysmography; aged; atrial fibrillation; cardioversion; female; heart atrium flutter; human; male; microcirculation; middle aged; photoelectric plethysmography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85154029692"

The increased invasiveness and risk of infection prevents the routine measurement of central BP. Arterial transfer functions can provide central BP estimates from clinically available peripheral measurements. However, current methods are either generalized, potentially lacking the ability to adapt to inter and intra subject variability, or individualized based on additional, clinically unavailable, pulse transit time measurements. This work proposes a novel, self-contained method for individualizing an arterial transfer function from a single peripheral pressure measurement, capable of accurately estimating central BP in a range of hemodynamic conditions. Methods: Pulse wave analysis of femoral BP waves was employed to formulate initial approximations of central BP and arterial inlet flow waveforms, to serve as objective functions for the identification of all model parameters. Root mean squared error (RMSE), and systolic and pulse pressure errors were assessed with respect to invasive aortic BP measurements in a seven (7) porcine endotoxin experiments. Systolic and pulse pressure errors were analysed using Bland-Altman analysis. Method accuracy is also compared with an idealized transfer function, derived using the measured aortic-femoral pulse transit time and minimizing the RMSE of model output pressure with respect to reference aortic pressure, a generalized transfer function model, and invasive femoral pressure measurements. Results: Mean bias and limits of agreement (95% CI) for the proposed method were 1.0(-4.6, 6.7)mmHg and -1.0(-6.6, 4.6)mmHg for systolic and pulse pressure, respectively, compared to 3.6(-0.9, 8.2)mmHg and 2.7(-1.8, 7.3)mmHg for the generalized transfer function model. Mean bias and limits of agreement for femoral pressure measurements were -6.4(-15.0, 2.3)mmHg and -9.4(-18.1, -0.8)mmHg, for systolic and pulse pressure, respectively. The pooled mean and standard deviation of the RMSE produced by the single measurement method, relative to reference aortic pressure, was 4.3(1.1)mmHg, consistent with estimates produced by the idealized transfer function, 3.9(1.2)mmHg, and improving of the generalized transfer function, 4.6(1.4)mmHg. Conclusions: The proposed single measurement method provides accurate central BP estimates from routinely available peripheral pressure measurements, and nothing else. The method allows for the individualization of transfer functions on a per patient basis to better capture changes in patient condition during the progression of disease and subsequent treatment, at no additional clinical cost. © 2022","Central blood pressure; Pulse transit time; Pulse wave analysis; Transfer function; Tube-load model; Wave reflection","Animals; Aorta; Arteries; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Hemodynamics; Pulse Wave Analysis; Swine; Blood; Blood vessels; Errors; Mean square error; Mercury compounds; Pressure measurement; Risk assessment; Transfer functions; Escherichia coli endotoxin; Central blood pressure; Load modeling; Pressure error; Pulse pressure; Pulse transit time; Pulse wave analysis; Root mean squared errors; Systolic pressure; Tube-load model; Wave reflections; animal experiment; aortic pressure; artery; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; hemodynamics; nonhuman; Pietrain pig; pulse pressure; pulse wave; root mean squared error; animal; aorta; blood pressure; physiology; pig; procedures; Blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145573877"

The purpose of our work was to reveal the dependence of changes in the cognitive sphere on the peculiarities of the daily profile of blood pressure (BP) and heart activity in patients with arrhythmias. Materials and methods. We examined 139 patients with different clinical forms of arrhythmias. All of them underwent extended neuropsychological testing, a study of the daily BP profile and heart activity. Hemodynamic status was assessed by daily BP and ECG monitoring. Average daily, average daytime and nighttime systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) were evaluated. The analysis of spectral indicators of heart rate variability was performed to assess the state of the autonomic nervous system. Correlations of hemodynamic indicators with the results of neuropsychological testing were determined. Results. In patients with cognitive disorders (CD), there was an increase in SBP in all periods of the day, most pronounced in patients with moderate CD (p = 0.049). In patients with mild CD and without CD, there were no significant intergroup differences in the level of average daily, daytime and night SBP, DBP and pulse pressure (p > 0.05). Patients with moderate CD had significantly higher SBP and time index of SBP at the expense of average daytime and average night values of these indicators compared to those without CD (p < 0.05). During the active period of the day, time index of DBP was significantly higher in patients with moderate CD (p = 0.002) who also had an increase in average daily, daytime and night SBP variability compared to participants without CD (p = 0.041). The differences between the groups were not significant in terms of DBP variability (р = 0.07). In 61 (54 %) patients with CD, non-dipper SBP prevailed in the structure of disorders of the daily BP profile, with the highest indicators in moderate CD (55.6 %). The presence of adverse daily DBP profiles — night-peaker (6.2 %) and over-dipper (8.8 %), which prevailed in patients with moderate CD, is hidden behind normal indicators of the daily BP index. Increased average SBP24 (odds ratio (OR) = 3.26, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45–5.35, p < 0.001), DBP24 (OR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.41–4.79, p < 0.001), average HR24 (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.32–4.14, p < 0.001), average SBP24 variability (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.11–3.32, p < 0.001) are the main factors of central hemodynamic disorders that increase the risk of developing CD in patients with arrhythmias. Conclusions. The identified associations between cognitive dysfunction, indicators of daily BP monitoring and heart activity are important in the context of their comprehensive accounting for optimizing an individualized approach to patient management and predicting the development of CD. © 2024.

Design: A prospective observational study. Setting: A surgical intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Participants: Seventy-four postoperative critically ill patients with acute circulatory failure were enrolled. Interventions: Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase of 10% or more in stroke volume after PLR, dividing patients into 2 groups: responders and nonresponders. Measurement and Main Results: Hemodynamic data were recorded at baseline and after PLR, and the stroke volume was measured by transthoracic echocardiography. Thirty-eight patients were responders, and 36 were nonresponders. ΔPPVPLR predicted fluid responsiveness with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.917, and the optimal cutoff value was 2.3%, with a gray zone of 1.6% to 3.3%, including 19 (25.7%) patients. ΔSPVPLR predicted fluid responsiveness with an AUC of 0.908, and the optimal cutoff value was 1.9%, with a gray zone of 1.1% to 2.0%, including 18 (24.3%) patients. No notable distinction was observed between the AUC for ΔPPVPLR and ΔSPVPLR (p = 0.805) in predicting fluid responsiveness. Conclusions: ΔSPVPLR and ΔPPVPLR could accurately predict fluid responsiveness in postoperative critically ill patients.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic polymorphisms on these differences. Methods: A total of 112 patients undergoing hand surgery were recruited. DXM 0.5 μg/kg was administered within 10 min and then continuously injected (0.4 μg/kg/h). Narcotrend index, effective dose and onset time of sedation, MAP, and HR were measured. Forty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected for genotype. Results: We observed individual differences in the sedation and hemodynamics induced by DXM. ABCG2 rs2231142, CYP2D6 rs16947, WBP2NL rs5758550, KATP rs141294036, KCNMB1 rs11739136, KCNMA1 rs16934182, ABCC9 rs11046209, ADRA2A rs1800544, and ADRB2 rs1042713 were shown to cause statistically significant (p < 0.05) influence on the individual variation of DXM on sedation and hemodynamics. Moreover, the multiple linear regression analysis indicated sex, BMI, and ADRA2A rs1800544 are statistically related to the effective dose of DXM sedation. Discussion: The evidence suggests that the nine SNPs involved in transport proteins, metabolic enzymes, and target proteins of DXM could explain the individual variability in the sedative and hemodynamic effects of DXM. Therefore, with SNP genotyping, these results could guide personalized medication and promote clinical and surgical management.

Genetic analysis in humans is one of the most important experimental approaches in uncovering disease mechanisms, but the relative infrequency of thoracic aortic disease compared with other cardiovascular conditions such as coronary artery disease has hindered large-scale identification of genetic associations. In the past decade, advances in machine learning technology coupled with large imaging datasets from biobank repositories have facilitated a rapid expansion in our capacity to measure and genotype aortic traits, resulting in the identification of dozens of genetic associations. In this Review, we describe the history of technological advances in genetic discovery and explain how newer technologies such as deep learning can rapidly define aortic traits at scale. Furthermore, we integrate novel genetic observations provided by these advances into our current biological understanding of thoracic aortic disease and describe how these new findings can contribute to strategies to prevent and treat aortic disease. © 2022, Springer Nature Limited.","","Aorta; Aortic Aneurysm; Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic; Aortic Coarctation; Aortic Diseases; Humans; guanine nucleotide exchange factor; hyaluronic acid; procollagen; transcription factor GATA 2; transforming growth factor beta; transgelin; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; aortic aneurysm; aortic disease; aortic dissection; aortic occlusion; arterial stiffness; balloon dilatation; bicuspid aortic valve; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; convolutional neural network; copy number variation; coronary artery calcium score; coronary artery disease; decellularization; deep learning; epigenetics; extracellular matrix; familial hypercholesterolemia; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic screening; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; health disparity; heart contraction; heart cycle; hemodynamic stress; hemodynamics; hemostasis; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; image quality; linkage analysis; machine learning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; pleiotropy; pulse wave; quality of life; Review; right coronary artery; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; systematic review; thoracic aorta; thoracic aorta aneurysm; vascular smooth muscle cell; whole exome sequencing; aorta; aortic aneurysm; aortic coarctation; genetics; thoracic aorta aneurysm","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138380316"

When used in conjunction with pulse oximetry, ORi extends the knowledge on a patient’s oxygen status providing clinically important information helping to prevent hyperoxemia and hypoxemia. There are limited data on patients undergoing craniosynostosis surgery. Our primary goal was to evaluate the effects of different concentrations of inspiratory oxygen (FiO2) on patient oxygenation status by monitoring ORi. Thirty patients scheduled for craniosynostosis were included in this observational cohort study. Patients were randomized into two equal groups: Group 1 received a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.8 and group 2 received a FiO2 of 0.6 during induction of anaesthesia. In addition to standard haemodynamic variables with ORi were recorded at baseline 1 min, 5 min, 60 min, and 120 min after intubation. Postoperative complications, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were recorded. In total, 14 patients were evaluated in each group. Gender, age, BMI, ASA scores were similar between groups (p > 0.05). In Group 1, ORi values were significantly higher when compared to group 2 at baseline (0.86 ± 0.21 vs 0.45 ± 0.32, p = 0.001), one minute (0.61 ± 0.24 vs 0.27 ± 0.21, p = 0.001), and 5 min (0.34 ± 0.31 vs 0.10 ± 0.13, p = 0.033). High inspired oxygen concentration during induction of anesthesia in pediatric patients is associated with higher levels of ORi. Therefore, ORi may provide the means to safely reduce the inspired oxygen fraction during inhalational induction in paediatric patients. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Hyperoxemia; Oxygen reserve index; Pediatric anesthesia","Anesthesia, General; Craniosynostoses; Humans; Hypoxia; Oximetry; Oxygen; Anesthesiology; Intensive care units; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Pediatrics; fentanyl; oxygen; paracetamol; rocuronium; sevoflurane; tramadol; oxygen; Continuous variables; Craniosynostosis; High oxygens; Hyperoxemia; Oxygen concentrations; Oxygen reserve index; Pediatric anesthesia; Pediatric patients; Pulse oximetry; Pulse-oximetry; age; American Society of Anaesthesiologists score; anesthesia induction; Article; body mass; body weight; child; clinical article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; craniofacial synostosis; demographics; electrocardiography; female; fraction of inspired oxygen; gender; heart rate; hematoma; hemodynamic parameters; human; hypothermia; infant; intensive care unit; length of stay; liquorrhea; lung ventilation; male; mean arterial pressure; observational study; operative blood loss; oxygen concentration; pediatric anesthesia; pediatric patient; perfusion index; plethysmographic variability index; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; postoperative complication; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; seizure; subcutaneous hematoma; surgical infection; tidal volume; treatment duration; wound dehiscence; adverse event; complication; craniofacial synostosis; general anesthesia; hypoxia; oximetry; Oxygen","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117947580"

However, the influence of RIPC on aerobic performance and underlying physiological mechanisms during hypobaric hypoxia (HH) exposure remains relatively uncertain. Here, we systematically evaluated the potential performance benefits and underlying mechanisms of RIPC during HH exposure. Seventy-nine healthy participants were randomly assigned to receive sham intervention or RIPC (4 × 5 min occlusion 180 mm Hg/reperfusion 0 mm Hg, bilaterally on the upper arms) for 8 consecutive days in phases 1 (24 participants) and phase 2 (55 participants). In the phases 1, we measured the change in maximal oxygen uptake capacity (VO2max) and muscle oxygenation (SmO2) on the leg during a graded exercise test. We also measured regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) on the forehead. These measures and physiological variables, such as cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability index, were used to evaluate the intervention effect of RIPC on the changes in bodily functions caused by HH exposure. In the phase 2, plasma protein mass spectrometry was then performed after RIPC intervention, and the results were further evaluated using ELISA tests to assess possible mechanisms. The results suggested that RIPC intervention improved VO2max (11.29%) and accelerated both the maximum (18.13%) and minimum (53%) values of SmO2 and rSO2 (6.88%) compared to sham intervention in hypobaric hypoxia exposure. Cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters (SV, SVRI, PPV% and SpMet%) and the heart rate variability index (Mean RR, Mean HR, RMSSD, pNN50, Lfnu, Hfnu, SD1, SD2/SD1, ApEn, SampEn, DFA1and DFA2) were evaluated. Protein sequence analysis showed 42 unregulated and six downregulated proteins in the plasma of the RIPC group compared to the sham group after HH exposure. Three proteins, thymosin β4 (Tβ4), heat shock protein-70 (HSP70), and heat shock protein-90 (HSP90), were significantly altered in the plasma of the RIPC group before and after HH exposure. Our data demonstrated that in acute HH exposure, RIPC mitigates the decline in VO2max and regional oxygenation, as well as physiological variables, such as cardiovascular hemodynamic parameters and the heart rate variability index, by influencing plasma Tβ4, HSP70, and HSP90.

Despite the existence of various techniques for noninvasively measuring CABP, the clinical applications of most techniques are hampered by the unsatisfactory accuracy or large variability in measurement errors. In this study, we proposed a new method for noninvasively estimating CABP with improved accuracy and reduced uncertain errors. The main idea was to optimize the estimation of the pulse wave transit time from the aorta to the occluded lumen of the brachial artery under a suprasystolic cuff by identifying and utilizing the characteristic information of the cuff oscillation wave, thereby improving the accuracy and stability of the CABP estimation algorithms under various physiological conditions. The method was firstly developed and verified based on large-scale virtual subject data (n = 800) generated by a computational model of the cardiovascular system coupled to a brachial cuff, and then validated with small-scale in vivo data (n = 34). The estimation errors for the aortic systolic pressure were −0.05 ± 0.63 mmHg in the test group of the virtual subjects and −1.09 ± 3.70 mmHg in the test group of the patients, both demonstrating a good performance. In particular, the estimation errors were found to be insensitive to variations in hemodynamic conditions and cardiovascular properties, manifesting the high robustness of the method. The method may have promising clinical applicability, although further validation studies with larger-scale clinical data remain necessary. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","central aortic blood pressure; noninvasive estimation; pulse wave transit time; suprasystolic brachial cuff; wave reconstruction","Aorta; Arterial Pressure; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Brachial Artery; Humans; Blood; Blood vessels; Errors; Hemodynamics; Central aortic blood pressures; Clinical study; Estimation errors; Large-scales; Noninvasive estimation; Optimisations; Peripheral blood; Pulse wave transit time; Suprasystolic brachial cuffs; Wave reconstruction; aorta; arterial pressure; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; brachial artery; human; physiology; procedures; Blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183675797"

Methods: Sixty patients, 1–3 years of age, undergoing major neurosurgery, received 10 mL/kg of Ringer's solution over 10 min after anesthesia induction. Respiratory variation in aortic blood flow peak velocity (∆Vpeak), plethysmographic variability index (PVI), FloTrac/Vigileo-derived stroke volume variation (SVV), dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn), and pulse pressure variation (PPV) were measured before and following fluid loading. An increase in the cardiac index (CI) of ≥10% following fluid loading identified fluid “responders.”. Results: Twenty-six patients (43.3%) were fluid responders. Baseline ∆Vpeak was an excellent predictor of a CI increase following fluid loading with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.982 (p < 0.001). The PVI showed fair diagnostic accuracy for CI-fluid responsiveness (AUROC 0.775, p < 0.001). Baseline ∆Vpeak and PVI cutoff values were 9.6% and 15%, respectively. PPV, SVV, and Eadyn were not predictors or were poor predictors for CI-fluid responsiveness (AUROC 0.669, 0.653, and 0.533, respectively). Conclusion: Volume-based PVI and ∆Vpeak showed acceptable reliability for fluid responsiveness prediction in young children undergoing major neurosurgery, whereas pressure-based SVV using FloTrac/Vigileo, Eadyn, and PPV did not. © 2023 Japan Pediatric Society.","child; fluid responsiveness; neurosurgery; plethysmographic variability index; stroke volume variation","Arteries; Blood Pressure; Child; Child, Preschool; Hemodynamics; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Stroke Volume; algorithm; aortic flow; Article; body surface; calibration; cardiac index; child; clinical article; clinical protocol; female; fluid flow; heart hemodynamics; heart output; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic monitoring; human; male; neurosurgery; observational study; perfusion index; plethysmography; prediction; transthoracic echocardiography; vascular resistance; waveform; artery; blood pressure; hemodynamics; physiology; preschool child; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152618421"

Experimental models and clinical trials show a reduction in vasopressor requirements and improved microcirculation compared to conventional sedation. Dexmedetomidine did not reduce mortality in clinical trials, but few septic shock patients were enrolled. This pilot trial aims to evaluate vasopressor re-sensitization with dexmedetomidine and assess the effect size, in order to design a larger trial. Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, comparing dexmedetomidine versus placebo in RSS patients with norepinephrine dose ≥0.5μg/kg/min. The primary outcome is blood pressure response to phenylephrine challenge, 6 hours after completion of a first challenge, after study treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes include feasibility and safety outcomes (bradycardia), mortality, vasopressor requirements, heart rate variability, plasma and urine catecholamines levels. The sample size is estimated at 32 patients to show a 20% improvement in blood pressure response to phenylephrine. Randomization (1:1) will be stratified by center, sedation type and presence of liver cirrhosis. Blood pressure and ECG will be continuously recorded for the first 24 h, enabling high-quality data collection for the primary and secondary endpoints. The study was approved by the ethics committee “Sud-Est VI” (2019-000726-22) and patients will be included after informed consent. Discussion: The present study will be the first randomized trial to specifically address the hemodynamic effects of dexmedetomidine in patients with septic shock. We implement a high-quality process for data acquisition and recording in the first 24 h, ensuring maximal quality for the evaluation of both efficacy and safety outcomes, as well as transparency of results. The results of the study will be used to elaborate a full-scale randomized controlled trial with mortality as primary outcome in RSS patients.

As a critical part of blood pressure regulation, baroreflex control is believed to be closely related to intraoperative blood pressure fluctuations. Spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability measurement can aid evaluation of patients' autonomic function. This study aims to determine the association between preoperative decreased baroreflex function and PIH in elderly patients. Methods and analysis This prospective cohort study will enrol patients who are 65 years old and above, scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III (n=180). Baseline assessment will include routine preoperative evaluations as well as symptoms and anamneses associated with baroreflex failure. Preoperative autonomic function monitoring will be performed through 20 min of continuous beat-to-beat heart rate and blood pressure monitoring using LiDCO rapid (Masimo Corporation, USA). The primary outcome will be PIH. Detailed use of anaesthetic agents during induction and maintenance will be documented for adjustment in multivariable analyses.

Methods: This randomized controlled study was performed on 15 Guizhou miniature pigs. Septic shock was induced by fecal peritonitis in 10 animals, and 5 were used as a sham-operated group (shams). Fluid resuscitation and vasopressors were initiated 30 min after the onset of septic shock. The septic shock pigs were randomly assigned to receive one of the two drugs to restore and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 65 mmHg for 3 h. Hemodynamics and heart rate were continuously monitored. Results: There was no significant difference in MAP, heart rate, cardiac output (CO) and central venous pressure (CVP) between the two groups after treatment. No arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation presented during continuous monitoring. After septic shock, the animals showed obvious kidney injury. In addition, compared with norepinephrine, the creatinine at 3 h was significantly lower with metaraminol. According to propensity score matching, the ratio of 6: 1 was considered appropriate for the dose equivalence calculation of metaraminol (μg·kg-1·min-1): norepinephrine (μg·kg-1·min-1). Conclusion: Metaraminol has a similar pressor effect to norepinephrine in septic shock; it does not increase heart rate and aggravate kidney injury after shock compared with norepinephrine. And our research may provide some laboratory evidence for the clinical usage of metaraminol. © 2024 The author(s)","acute kidney injury; conversion dose ratio; heart rate; metaraminol; septic shock","creatinine; metaraminol; noradrenalin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; central venous pressure; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; creatinine blood level; dose ratio; drug effect; electrochemiluminescence; endotracheal intubation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fluid resuscitation; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; histopathology; image analysis; kidney function; kidney injury; male; mean arterial pressure; minipig; nonhuman; open study; peritonitis; radioimmunoprecipitation; randomized controlled trial; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; septic shock; Western blotting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200133229"

Our invasive study assessed the FF value and variability at the radial and femoral artery levels and evaluated the recommended fixed FF value of 0.33. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hemodynamically stable patients were prospectively included in 2 intensive care units. FF was documented at baseline and during dynamic maneuvers. A total of 632 patients (64±16years of age, 66% men, MAP=81±14mmHg) were in-cluded. Among them, 355 (56%) had a radial catheter and 277 (44%) had a femoral catheter. The FF was 0.34±0.06. In multiple linear regression, FF was influenced by biological sex (P<0.0001) and heart rate (P=0.04) but not by height, weight, or catheter location. The radial FF was 0.35±0.06, whereas the femoral FF was 0.34±0.05 (P=0.08). Both radial and femoral FF were higher in women than in men (P<0.05). When using the 0.33 FF value to estimate MAP, the error was −0.4±4.0mmHg and −0.1±2.9mmHg at the radial and femoral level, respectively, and the MAP estimate still demonstrated high accuracy and good precision even after changes in norepi-nephrine dose, increase in positive end-expiratory pressure level, fluid administration, or prone positioning (n=218). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher FF in women and despite interindividual variability in FF, using a fixed FF value of 0.33 yielded accurate and precise estimations of MAP.

We sought to investigate the impact of renal denervation on pulsatile left ventricular loading in patients with HFpEF and hypertensive patients without heart failure (control). Methods: Patients underwent renal denervation for treatment of hypertension and were followed up at 3 months at a single center. A validated computer model of the arterial tree, noninvasive aortic flow curves, left ventricular volumes, and E/e′ as inputs were used to determine key parameters of left ventricular vascular load. Results: In comparison to controls (n=30), patients with HFpEF (n=30) demonstrated lower total arterial compliance (mean difference, -0.41 [95% CI, -0.72 to -0.10] mL/mm Hg), higher impedance of the proximal aorta (Zc: 0.02; 0.01 to 0.04 mHg·s/mL), premature wave reflections (shorter backward wave transit time normalized to ejection time: -3.5; -6.5% to -0.5%), and higher wave reflection magnitude (reflection coefficient: 7.3; 2.8% to 11.9%). Overall, daytime systolic (-9.2; -12.2 to -6.2 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressures (-5.9; -7.6 to -4.1 mm Hg) as well as blood pressure variability (-2.0; -3.0 to -0.9 mm Hg) decreased after renal denervation. In patients with HFpEF, total arterial compliance (0.42; 0.17 to 0.67 mL/mm Hg) and backward transit time normalized to ejection time (1.7; 0.4% to 3.0%) increased; Zc (-0.01; -0.02 to -0.01 mm Hg·s/mL) and reflection coefficient (-2.6; -5.0% to -0.3%) decreased after renal denervation. This was accompanied by a symptomatic improvement in patients with HFpEF. Conclusion: HFpEF is characterized by heightened aortic stiffness and unfavorable pulsatile left ventricular load. These abnormalities are partly normalized after renal denervation. © 2023 The Authors.

Hence, it is important to investigate hemodynamic parameters which may be useful in identifying patients at risk of hypotension, following induction. Our study was designed to assess the utility of parameters derived from ultrasonography, pulse oximeter and arterial line for predicting post-induction hypotension. Methods: The study was designed as a prospective, observational trial. Written informed consent was obtained from 100 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 1 and 2 patients, between 18-60 years of age, scheduled for elective craniotomy for brain tumors. Arterial cannula was inserted before induction of anesthesia and connected to Vigileo cardiac output monitor. Baseline stroke volume variation (SVV), stroke volume (SV), cardiac index (Ci), cardiac output (CO) and pulse pressure variation (PPV) were recorded. Plethysmography variability index (PVI) and perfusion index (PI) were obtained from the Masimo rainbow SET® Radical-7® pulse oximeter. Ultrasonographic assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC) was performed before induction of anesthesia and again within 15 min after induction. Maximum and minimum IVC diameters (dIVCmax and dIVCmin) and collapsibility index (CI) were measured. All the other aforementioned parameters were recorded every minute starting at induction, until the 15th minute following induction. Results: PI, CI and dIVCmax were found to have the largest AUCROC for the prediction of post-induction hypotension (AUCROC 0.852, 0.823 and 0.781 respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed CI to be the most significant independent factor for the prediction of post-induction hypotension. Conclusion: Non-invasively derived hemodynamic parameters like dIVCmax, CI and PI were more accurate for the prediction of post-induction hypotension, compared to invasively derived parameters. © 2022 The Author(s)","Collapsibility index; Hypotension; Perfusion index; Plethysmographic variability index; Ultrasonography","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140806439"

We evaluated fluid responsiveness in the first hours after surgery by determining the variability of the velocity–time integral of the left ventricular outflow tract (VTI-LVOT). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 50 consecutive adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery and in whom it was possible to obtain VTI-LVOT measurements. We then determined the variability and correlations with our pulse pressure variation (PPV) measurements to predict fluid responsiveness. Results: A strong positive correlation was seen between the VTI-LVOT variability index absolute values and PPV for predicting fluid responsiveness in the first hours after cardiac surgery. We also found that the VTI-LVOT variability index has high specificity and a high positive likelihood ratio compared with the gold standard using a cut-off point of ≥ 12%. Conclusions: The VTI-LVOT variability index is a valuable tool for determining fluid responsiveness during the first 6 postoperative hours in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. © 2023, The Author(s).","Cardiac surgery; Fluid responsiveness; Hemodynamic monitoring","adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; gold standard; heart left ventricle outflow tract; heart surgery; hemodynamic monitoring; human; male; pulse pressure; velocity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163647522"

Tracheal intubation may induce potentially deleterious hemodynamic disturbances or motor reactions if analgesia is inadequate. We investigated whether ANI modification generated by a standardized moderate short tetanic stimulation performed before laryngoscopy could predict hemodynamic or somatic reactions to subsequent intubation. We designed a prospective, interventional, monocentric, pilot study. Regional ethics board approved the study, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Before laryngoscopy, under steady-state total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol and remifentanil, the ulnar nerve was stimulated with a 5 s tetanus (70 mA, 50 Hz). After another steady-state period, orotracheal intubation was performed. ANI variation, hemodynamic parameters and somatic reactions associated with tetanus and intubation were collected. To assess the predictability of hemodynamic or somatic reaction during laryngoscopy by tetanus-induced ANI variation, we calculated the area under the corresponding Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUCROC) and the 95% confidence intervals. Thirty-five patients were analyzed. ANI decreased by 21 ± 17 after tetanus. Regarding the ability of tetanus-induced ANI variation to predict hemodynamic or somatic reactions during subsequent intubation, the AUCROCs [95% CI] were 0.61 [0.41–0.81] and 0.52 [0.31–0.72] respectively. ANI varied after a short moderate tetanic stimulation performed before laryngoscopy but this variation was not predictive of a hemodynamic or somatic reaction during intubation.

Thus, we investigated the BP changes associated with variations in PWTT and identified the clinical characteristics associated with these variations. Data related to 605 cases of dental procedures performed under intravenous conscious sedation from April 2020 to November 2021 were collected, and 485 cases were enrolled. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure before and after local anesthesia (LA) administration, and crest and trough PWTT waves during LA administration were recorded. Thereafter, PWTT variability was calculated; cases were divided into two groups: large PWTT variability (LPV, n = 357) and small PWTT variability (SPV, n = 128). The index of large PWTT variability could not detect changes in BP. Logistic regression analysis revealed that factors, such as LA use, age, hypertension, and dental treatment phobia were associated with PWTT variability. The use of epinephrine more than 36.25 µg in each LA resulted in PWTT variability of more than 15 ms. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the association between blood pressure (BP) and CVD events has been based on mean BP alone. BP variability (BPV) is associated with increased organ damage and CVD events independently or beyond average home BP. To explain this association, we propose the systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome (SHATS) hypothesis. The SHATS hypothesis indicates that hemodynamic stress increases vascular disease and vice versa, leading to a vicious cycle of the association between hemodynamic stress and a vascular disease; this association provides not only the risk but also the trigger for CVD events. The evidences of SHATS were gradually accumulating. We showed arterial stiffness synergistically amplified the association between hemodynamic stress and cardiac overload / CVD events in patients with at least one CVD risk factor.

Children with cancer undergo many operations and procedures that require anesthesia in the acute phase of the disease or during remission. An integral element of a safe anesthesia plan is the consideration of direct tumor effects. The localization of the tumor process, the features of the body of a child suffering from cancer, his reaction to a stressful situation force an anesthesiologist to select an anesthetic carefully and consider all possible complications during anesthesia. Many researchers have compared the effects of different analgesics and anesthetics, especially sevoflurane and propofol, namely their effect on pain, ability to prevent or reduce intraoperative stress, as well as the postoperative recovery and adverse complications after various surgical interventions. However, a comparative study of sevoflurane and propofol in the surgical treatment of cancers in children has not been conducted. The aim of the study: to сompare the analgesic and anti-stress effects of inhalation and intravenous anesthesia in children with cancer by studying their hemodynamic response, level of cortisol, proinflammatory cytokines, and heart rate variability indicators. Materials and methods. We have examined forty-nine children with cancer (the first group) who were treated surgically. They were divided into two subgroups depending on the type of anesthetic care - sevoflurane/fentanyl (n = 26) and propofol/fentanyl (n = 23). In the structure of surgical interventions, laparotomy with removal of the tumor prevailed (36 children). Thoracic operations were performed in 13 oncological cases. To compare the characteristics of sevoflurane and propofol in patients with cancer, 49 children (the second group) operated for various traumatological pathologies were included in the examination. Hemodynamic indicators (heart rate, systolic, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure), the number of circulating blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, the level of C-reactive protein and interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, plasma cortisol were evaluated. The activity of the autonomic nervous system was measured using indicators of heart rate variability. Results. During inhalation and intravenous anesthesia, heart rate and mean arterial pressure had the same direction and decreased in all observed patients, but in children with cancer, mean arterial pressure decreased more with sevoflurane. The level of stress during oncological operations and the use of inhalation anesthesia was lower compared to intravenous anesthesia. Against the background of propofol, the cortisol level in these patients increased to 286.80 nmol/l (interquartile range 244.90-374.50), and during inhalation anesthesia - to 303.20 nmol/l (interquartile range 299.90-398.60; p = 0.0494). Similar dynamics was observed for the level of interleukin-6, the difference in its increase was 7 %. Heart rate variability indicators showed that neither sevoflurane nor propofol changed the power of the low-frequency component of the spectrum. Only in the group of cancer patients, the value of the “very” low-frequency component of the spectrum indicated an increase in the activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system after intravenous anesthesia (p < 0.05). Conclusions. It is still not possible to say convincingly about any advantage between inhalation and intravenous anesthesia in reducing the level of intraoperative stress in cancer. The type of the tumor process, its duration, the degree of potentially large physiological disorders should determine the plan of anesthesia and the choice of an appropriate anesthetic. © 2022.

Methods A total of 98 septic shock patients were selected for clinical research. According to the stroke volume change (ΔSV) of patients before and after rehydration treatment, the patients were divided into 53 cases of volume load positive group (ΔSV≥15%) and 45 cases of volume load negative group (ΔSV< 15%) . The pulse-indicated continuous cardiac output (PICCO) and echocardiogram related indexes for two groups of patients before and after the volume load test were compared, and the receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to analyze the value of statistically significant indexes for septic shock to the patient’ s response to the volume load test. A logistics regression model was used to analyze the relationship between various parameters and the volume load test response. Results Before the volume load test, the measured cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume variation (SVV), central venous pressure (CVP), heart rate (HR) values of patients in two groups were compared, and the difference was not statistically significant (P>0. 05) . After the test, the CO, CI, and CVP values of volume load positive group were all higher than those of volume load negative group (P<0. 05), and the HR and SVV values were lower than those of volume load negative group (P < 0. 05) . Before the volume load test, there was no significant difference in measured left ventricular outflow tract inner diameter velocity-time integral (LVOT VTI), LVOT peak flow velocity respiratory variability, and VEpeak values of patients between two groups (P> 0. 05) . After the test, the LVOT VTI measurement value of the positive volume load group was higher than that of the negative volume load group (P< 0. 05), LVOT peak flow velocity respiratory variability was lower than volume load negative group (P < 0. 05) . ROC curve results showed that for HR, CO, CI, CVP, SVV, LVOT peak flow velocity respiratory variability, LVOT VTI index prediction, the positive area under the curve (AUC) values of the volume load response were 0. 515, 0. 560, 0. 556, 0. 499, 0. 898, 0. 912, 0. 922, respectively. Logistic regression model results showed that the higher the APACHEⅡ score, the higher the SOFA score, the lower the CO, the lower the CI, and the lower the CVP, the higher the SVV, the lower the LVOT VTI, and the greater LVOT peak flow velocity respiratory variability, these were independent risk factors for the negative volume load test in septic shock patients (P< 0. 05) . Conclusions Closely monitoring the relevant hemodynamic parameters of patients with septic shock has a clinical value for predicting the patient’ s volume load response, and it can guide patients in clinical fluid resuscitation. © 2023 Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine.

Despite the tremendous technological advances in recent years, objective, continuous assessment of physiological measures post-vaccination is rarely performed. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study during the mass vaccination campaign in Israel. 160 participants >18 years who were not previously found to be COVID-19 positive and who received the BNT162b2 COVID-19 (Pfizer BioNTech) vaccine were equipped with an FDA-approved chest-patch sensor and a dedicated mobile application. The chest-patch sensor continuously monitored 13 different cardiovascular, and hemodynamic vitals: heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, heart rate variability, stroke volume, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance and skin temperature. The mobile application collected daily self-reported questionnaires on local and systemic reactions. Results: We identify continuous and significant changes following vaccine administration in nearly all vitals. Markedly, these changes are observed even in presumably asymptomatic participants who did not report any local or systemic reaction. Changes in vitals are more apparent at night, in younger participants, and in participants following the second vaccine dose. Conclusion: the considerably higher sensitivity of wearable sensors can revolutionize clinical trials by enabling earlier identification of abnormal reactions with fewer subjects. © 2022, The Author(s).","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136105116"

Experimental research generally supports these findings as metrics of arterial function are impaired after complete deprivation of sleep and after longer periods of partial sleep restriction. The acute influence of a single instance of partial sleep restriction (PSR), however, has not been defined. We evaluated arterial structure and function among 32 university-aged participants on two occasions: once after normal habitual sleep (NS), and again the morning after an acute partial sleep restriction (PSR) intervention involving only 3 h of sleep for a single night. Endothelial function was measured using ultrasonography at the brachial artery via flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), and a ramp peak oxygen uptake test was used to evaluate cardiorespiratory fitness. Blood samples were collected from a subset of participants to investigate the influence of circulatory factors on cellular mechanisms implicated in endothelial function. Sleep duration was lower after a night of PSR compared to NS (P < 0.001); however, there were no appreciable differences in any haemodynamic outcome between conditions. FMD was not different between NS and PSR (NS: 6.5 ± 2.9%; PSR: 6.3 ± 2.9%; P = 0.668), and cardiorespiratory fitness did not moderate the haemodynamic response to PSR (all P > 0.05). Ex vivo cell culture results aligned with in vivo data, showing that acute PSR does not alter intracellular processes involved in endothelial function. No differences in arterial structure or function were observed between NS and acute PSR in healthy and young participants, and cardiorespiratory fitness does not modulate the arterial response to acute sleep restriction. © 2024 The Author(s).

We hypothesized that heart rate and blood pressure control at rest and during postural maneuvers in MIS-C patients, months after the remission of the inflammatory syndrome, may reveal long-term autonomic dysfunctions. Methods: We assessed 17 MIS-C patients (13 males; 11.9 ± 2.6 years, m ± SD) 9 months after acute infection and 18 age- (12.5 ± 2.1 years) and sex- (13 males) matched controls. Heart rate and blood pressure variability, baroreflex function, and hemodynamic parameters were analyzed in supine and standing postures. Results: MIS-C patients exhibited reduced heart rate variability, particularly in parasympathetic parameters during standing (pNN50+: 6.1 ± 6.4% in controls, 2.5 ± 3.9% in MIS-C; RMSSD: 34 ± 19 ms in controls, 21 ± 14 ms in MIS-C, p < 0.05), with no interaction between case and posture. Blood pressure variability and baroreflex sensitivity did not differ between groups except for the high-frequency power in systolic blood pressure (3.3 ± 1.2 mmHg2 in controls, 1.8 ± 1.2 mmHg2 in MIS-C, p < 0.05). The MIS-C group also showed lower diastolic pressure–time indices (DPTI) and systolic pressure–time indices (SPTI), particularly in standing (DPTI: 36.2 ± 9.4 mmHg·s in controls, 29.4 ± 6.2 mmHg·s in MIS-C; SPTI: 26.5 ± 4.3 mmHg·s in controls, 23.9 ± 2.4 mmHg·s in MIS-C, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Altered cardiovascular autonomic control may persist in MIS-C patients with, however, compensatory mechanisms that may help maintain cardiovascular homeostasis during light autonomic challenges, such as postural maneuvers. These results highlight the importance of assessing long-term cardiovascular autonomic control in children with MIS-C to possibly identify residual cardiovascular risks and inform targeted interventions and rehabilitation protocols. © 2024 by the authors.","adolescent; autonomic nervous system; baroreflex sensitivity; heart rate variability; MIS-C; pediatric","adolescent; adult; Article; autonomic dysfunction; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure regulation; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular autoregulation; cardiovascular risk; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; female; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; homeostasis; human; male; observational study; parasympathetic function; pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome; pressoreceptor reflex; prospective study; pulse pressure; remission; risk reduction; standing; supine position; systolic blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199922185"

However, recent studies have suggested that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) would promote great benefits for cardiac autonomic control. Therefore, we investigated whether the benefits of HIIT related to cardiovascular autonomic control were greater than those of MICT in women with PCOS. Methods: Women with PCOS were randomly allocated through a blind draw into three groups: control, MICT, and HIIT. The control group did not undergo exercise, whereas those in the MICT and HIIT groups underwent 16 weeks of aerobic physical training. All groups were evaluated before and after the 16 weeks of intervention in the following aspects: quantification of serum lipids, testosterone, fasting insulin and blood glucose; physical fitness through cardiopulmonary testing; analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) by linear (time domain and frequency domain) and non-linear (symbolic analysis) methods, analysis of blood pressure variability (BPV) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). Results: The final analysis, each group comprised 25 individuals. All groups had similar baseline parameters. After 16 weeks, intragroup comparison showed that the MICT and HIIT groups had a reduction in baseline heart rate (P < 0.001; P < 0.001, respectively) and testosterone levels P < 0.037; P < 0.012, respectively) associated with an increase in VO2peak (MICT, P < 0.001; HIIT, P < 0.001). The MICT (P < 0.36) and HIIT (P < 0.17) groups also showed an increase in cardiac vagal modulation, however only observed in the non-linear analysis. The intergroup comparison showed no differences between the MICT and HIIT groups in any of the hormonal, metabolic and autonomic parameters evaluated, including testosterone, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), HRV, BPV and BRS. Conclusion: HIIT and MICT showed similar results for the different parameters evaluated. This suggests that both training protocols can be recommended for the treatment of PCOS.

This study compared vagal-cardiac modulation and carotid baroreflex (CBR) function in eight physically active (67.6 ± 1.9 years; peak O2 uptake 29.1 ± 2.5 mL/min/kg) versus eight sedentary (67.3 ± 1.8 years; peak O2 uptake 18.6 ± 0.9 mL/min/kg) elderly women. Heart rate (HR) variabilities and maximal changes of HR and mean arterial pressure (MAP) elicited by 5-s pressure pulses between +40 and −80 mmHg applied to the carotid sinus were measured at rest and during carotid baroreceptor unloading effected by −15 mmHg lower-body negative pressure (LBNP). HR variability was greater in active than sedentary women in both low (0.998 ± 0.286 versus 0.255 ± 0.063 bpm2; P = 0.036) and high (0.895 ± 0.301 versus 0.156 ± 0.045 bpm2; P = 0.044) frequency domains. CBR-HR gains (bpm/mmHg) were greater (fitness factor P < 0.001) in active versus sedentary women at rest (−0.146 ± 0.014 versus −0.088 ± 0.011) and during LBNP (−0.105 ± 0.014 versus −0.065 ± 0.008). CBR-MAP gains (mmHg/mmHg) tended to be greater (fitness factor P = 0.077) in active versus sedentary women at rest (−0.132 ± 0.013 versus −0.110 ± 0.011) and during LBNP (−0.129 ± 0.015 versus −0.113 ± 0.013). However, LBNP did not potentiate CBR-MAP gains in either sedentary or active women (LBNP factor P = 0.94), and it depressed CBR-HR gains in both groups (LBNP factor P = 0.003). CBR-HR gains in the sedentary women did not differ (sex factor P = 0.65) from gains reported in age-matched sedentary men, although CBR-MAP gains tended to be greater (sex factor P = 0.109) in the men. Thus, tonic vagal modulation indicated by HR variability and dynamic vagal responses assessed by CBR-HR gain were augmented in physically active women. Enhanced vagal-cardiac function may protect against senescence-associated cardiac electrical and hemodynamic instability in elderly women. © 2023 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.","Carotid baroreflex; heart rate variability; physical fitness; vagal-cardiac function","Aged; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Carotid Arteries; Exercise; Female; Heart; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; aged; arterial pressure; Article; blood pressure; cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiovascular function; carotid sinus; carotid sinus pressoreceptor; carotid sinus pressoreceptor reflex; electrocardiography; female; fitness; forearm blood flow; heart function; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart stroke volume; human; hypovolemia; impedance plethysmography; lower body negative pressure; male; mean arterial pressure; modulation; oxygen consumption; peak oxygen uptake; physical activity; power analysis; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse pressure; reflex tachycardia; sedentary lifestyle; sex factor; vagal cardiac modulation; vagus nerve stimulation; carotid artery; exercise; heart; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153611313"

To analyze the use of the Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM), an hemodynamic monitoring system, in evaluating intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic instability in patients undergoing endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm, and to evaluate if the decision to refer patients to a ordinary ward or to a Cardiac Step-Down Unit (CSDU) after the intervention on the basis of intraoperative hemodynamic monitoring could be more cost-effective. Materials and Methods. After preoperative clinical evaluation, 44 patients were divided in this non-randomised study into two groups according to their postoperative destination: Group 1-ward (N=22) and Group 2-CSDU (N=22). All patients underwent monitoring with PRAM during the intervention and in the 24 postoperative hours, measuring several indices of myocardial contractility and other hemodynamic variables. Results. According to the variability of two parameters, Stroke Volume Variation and Pulse Pressure Variation, patients were classified as stable or unstable. Unstable patients showed a significant alteration in several hemodynamic indices, in comparison to stable ones. According to the intraoperative monitoring, eight high risk patients could have been sent to an ordinary ward due to their stability, with a reduction in the improper use of CSDU and, consequently, in costs. Conclusions. Hemodynamic monitoring with PRAM can be useful in these patients, both for intraoperative management and for the choice of the more appropriate postoperative setting, possibly reducing the improper use of CSDU for hemodynamically stable patients who are judged to be at high risk preoperatively, and re-evaluating low surgical risk patients with an unstable intraoperative pattern, with a possible reduction in costs. © 2024 Giacomelli et al.","Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm; Endovascular Repair; Goal Directed Therapy; Hemodynamic Monitoring; Postoperative Setting","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Blood Pressure; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Hemodynamic Monitoring; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Postoperative Period; abdominal aortic aneurysm; aged; blood pressure; cost benefit analysis; economics; endovascular surgery; female; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; human; intraoperative monitoring; male; middle aged; physiology; postoperative period; procedures; surgery; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198434464"

Inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) is the commonly used nerve block procedure for mandibular anaesthesia. Hence, we evaluate the efficacy of IANB for intraoperative analgesia to block consumption of opioids and propofol in intraoperative period and to note hemodynamic stability by monitoring pulse rate, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) during the intraoperative period. Methods: This randomized pilot study comprised of 25 patients with American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 1 or 2 were scheduled for mandibulectomy. The study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in south India between November 2017 and December 2018. The patients were then randomly assigned using computer-generated random number tables into two groups: A and B. Group A received only general anaesthesia and group B received general anaesthesia with IANB. The group allocation was done using concealed envelopes by the principal investigator and hemodynamic variables were noted by an independent observer who was not part of group allocation or administration of block. The group allocation was revealed to the surgical team only on the day of surgery. The primary outcome measured was consumption of fentanyl and propofol boluses in intraoperative period. The hemodynamic variability was also measured. Secondary outcomes were vascular and neurological complications if any. Statistical significance was accepted as P<0.05. Results: A total of 13 patients were randomized to Group A and 12 to Group B. Mean fentanyl consumption [Group A: n=8 (66.67%), μ=67.5±24.35 mcg/kg vs. Group B: n=6 (60%), μ=41.67±14.72 mcg/kg, P>0.99] and bolus propofol required (Group A n=5, 24±20.74 mg/kg vs. Group B n=3, 23.33±5.77 mg/kg, P=0.69) were not significantly different in both the groups. The mean time of onset of action was observed at 8.35±4.5 minutes after nerve block, where all twelve patients in Group B reported numbness of teeth and nine of them reported numbness in the tongue and two of them also were positive for aspiration test. The mean pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were also comparable between both the groups, however, the mean MAP was significantly less in Group B than Group A during dental extraction and at 30 minutes during intraoperative period (P=0.009). Conclusions: Based on primary outcome, the efficacy of IANB with general anaesthesia was comparable to that of general anaesthesia alone. Consumption of opioids and propofol in intraoperative period and hemodynamic stability during the intraoperative period was not significantly altered after administration of IANB.

METHODS: This retrospective study assessed the accuracy of PVI in predicting high PPV (>13%) using high resolution vital records acquired during neurosurgery. In addition, a new set of cut-off values of PVI for predicting PPV >13% was derived using a gray-zone approach. This study included consecutive patients who underwent neurosurgery with both PPV and PVI monitoring in a single operating room. Vital data from each individual were aggregated after 1000 repeated random samplings to generate a pooled data set. The discriminative power of PVI was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. A new set of cut-offs was derived, in which sensitivity or specificity was ≥0.90. RESULTS: A total of 730,000 seconds of data from 73 patients were analyzed. The Spearman correlation co-efficient between PPV and PVI in the pooled data set was 0.356 and repeated measures correlation was 0.199. The optimal cut-off of PVI for >13% PPV was 14.5, with a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.70 (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.739). The newly determined lower and upper cut-offs for the gray-zone approach were 9 and 21, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A single cut-off value of PVI may not accurately predict fluid responsiveness. Using a gray-zone approach, PVI <9 or >21 can rule in or rule out high PPV and may be more useful in actual clinical practice. © 2023 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Arterial pressure; Fluid therapy; Hemodynamic monitoring; Perfusion index; Plethysmography","noradrenalin; adult; aged; arterial pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; body mass; brain surgery; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diastolic arterial pressure; female; fluid therapy; heart rate; hemodynamic monitoring; high pulse pressure variation; human; hypertension; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; neurosurgery; perfusion index; Plethysmographic Variability Index; plethysmography; pulse pressure; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; spine surgery; systolic arterial pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85194430390"

Evaluation of fluid responsiveness is crucial in mechanically ventilated children to avoid fluid overload, which increases mortality. We aim to review and compare the diagnostic performance of dynamically hemodynamic parameters for predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. Design: A systematic review was performed using four electronic databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Central, for published articles from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2020. Studies were included if they described diagnostic performance of dynamic parameters after fluid challenge was performed in mechanically ventilated children. Settings: Pediatric intensive and cardiac intensive care unit, and operative room. Patients: Children aged 1 month to 18 years old who were under mechanical ventilation and required an intravenous fluid challenge. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-seven studies were included in the systematic review, which included 1,005 participants and 1,138 fluid challenges. Respiratory variation in aortic peak velocity was reliable among dynamic parameters for predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. All studies of respiratory variation in aortic peak velocity showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.71 to 1.00, and the cutoff value for determining fluid responsiveness ranged from 7% to 20%. Dynamic parameters based on arterial blood pressure (pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation) were also used in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. The plethysmography variability index was used in children undergoing neurological and general surgery, including the pediatric intensive care patients. Conclusions: The respiratory variation in aortic peak velocity exhibited a promising diagnostic performance across all populations in predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. High sensitivity is advantageous in non-cardiac surgical patients and the pediatric intensive care unit because early fluid resuscitation improves survival in these patients. Furthermore, high specificity is beneficial in congenital heart surgery because fluid overload is particularly detrimental in this group of patients.

Methods: Two hundred and sixty-eight parturients with pre-delivery hypotension after spinal anesthesia were equally randomized to (1) Group P/E (n = 134), phenylephrine 100 mcg in 10 mL intravenously if HR ≥ 60 beats/min (bpm), or ephedrine 6 mg intravenously if HR < 60 bpm, and 2) Group C (n = 134). The primary outcome was the incidence of the parturients with abnormal HR after vasopressor administration. The secondary outcome was the mean differences of HR and hypotensive periods during the pre-delivery period. Results: There was no significant difference of between-group incidences of bradycardia (12.0% in Group P/E vs 6.7% in Group C, p = 0.136) and tachycardia (26.9% vs 35.8%, p = 0.114). Mean HR was 81.9 bpm (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.9, 84.3) in Group P/E, and 88.8 bpm (86.8, 90.6) in Group C (p < 0.001). The duration of hypotension in relation to the time interval from spinal anesthesia to delivery was 20.9% (95% CI 18.4–23.2) in Group P/E, and 26.5% (23.9–29.3) in Group C (p < 0.01). The calculated area under the curve (AUC) of abnormal HR in relation to time was significantly reduced only in Group P/E (p < 0.010).

This study compared the predictive potential of the pleth variability index (PVI), pulse pressure variability (PPV), and perfusion index (PI) for anaesthesia-induced hypotension. This study's primary objective was to evaluate the predictive potential of PI, PVI, and PPV for hypotension. Methods: This observational study included 140 adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, PVI, PPV, and PI were collected at 1-min intervals up to 20 min post anaesthesia induction. Hypotension was assessed at 5-min and 15-min intervals. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to determine the diagnostic performance and best cut-off for continuous variables in predicting a dichotomous outcome. Statistical significance was kept at P < 0.05. Results: Hypotension prevalence within 5 and 15 min of anaesthesia induction was 36.4% and 45%, respectively. A PI cut-off of <3.5 had an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.647 (P = 0.004) for a 5-min hypotension prediction. The PVI's AUROC was 0.717 (P = 0.001) at cut-off >11.5, while PPV's AUROC was 0.742 (P = 0.001) at cut-off >12.5. At 15 min, PVI's AUROC was 0.615 (95% confidence interval 0.521-0.708, P = 0.020), with 54.9% positive predictive value and 65.2% negative predictive value. Conclusion: PVI, PPV, and PI predicted hypotension within 5 min after general anaesthesia induction. PVI had comparatively higher accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value than PI and PPV when predicting hypotension at 15 min.  © 2024 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia.","Anaesthesia; haemodynamics; hypotension; perfusion index; pleth variability index; prediction; pulse pressure variability","atropine; fentanyl; mephentermine; propofol; vecuronium; abdominal surgery; adult; anesthesia induction; Article; bradycardia; diagnostic test accuracy study; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiography; extubation; female; general anesthesia; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; hypotension; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; observational study; perfusion index; prediction; predictive value; prevalence; pulse oximetry; pulse pressure; receiver operating characteristic; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; spinal anesthesia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187984010"

Pleth Variability Index (PVI) is a non-invasive, dynamic index based on analysis of the respiratory variations in the plethysmographic waveform recorded transcutaneously by the pulse oximeter. Objectives: The objective of the study was to evaluate if the hemodynamic effect of improved left-sided output after successful transcatheter mitral valve repair would lead to a significant change in PVI, and if it would correlate with the decrease in left atrial pressure (LAP). Design: Prospective, observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03993938). Setting: Single academic hospital in Detroit, Michigan (USA), from October 2019 to February 2021. Participants: The authors included adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation who underwent successful MitraClip placement. Measurements and Main Results: Of 30 patients, all components of the LAP (a wave, v wave, and mean) decreased significantly after successful MitraClip placement (P <.01). The median (IQR) PVI increased from 21 (11-35) to 23 (13-38) after clip placement; however, this change was not statistically significant (P =.275). No significant correlation between change in PVI and change in LAP was observed (P =.235). Conclusions: In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, successful MitraClip resulted in a significant reduction in LAP without a significant change in PVI. A larger sample size may provide more insight on the utility of using PVI as an indicator of LAP change in patients with mitral regurgitation. © The Author(s) 2024.","left atrial pressure; MitraClip; mitral regurgitation; Pleth Variability Index","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196121453"

Both conditions share some common characteristics and pathophysiological pathways, making the two processes similar in several aspects. Their diagnostic differentiation is based on hemodynamic data on right heart catheterization, cardiac structural modifications, and therapeutic response. More specifically, PH secondary to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) shares features with type 1 PH (PAH), especially when the combined pre-and post-capillary form (CpcPH) takes place in advanced stages of the disease. Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a common consequence related to worse prognosis and lower survival. This condition has recently been identified with a new classification based on clinical signs and progression markers. The role and prevalence of PH and RV dysfunction in HFpEF remain poorly identified, with wide variability in the literature reported from the largest clinical trials. Different parenchymal and vascular alterations af-fect the two diseases. Capillaries and arteriole vasoconstriction, vascular obliteration, and pulmonary blood fluid redistribution from the basal to the apical district are typical manifestations of type 1 PH. Conversely, PH related to HFpEF is primarily due to an increase of venules/capillaries parietal fibro-sis, extracellular matrix deposition, and myocyte hypertrophy with a secondary “arteriolarization” of the vessels. Since the development of structural changes and the therapeutic target substantially differ, a better understanding of pathobiological processes underneath PH-HFpEF, and the identification of potential maladaptive RV mechanisms with an appropriate diagnostic tool, become mandatory in order to distinguish and manage these two similar forms of pulmonary hypertension. © 2022 by the authors.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the intravascular volume status with passive leg-raising maneuver (PLRM), vena cava inferior (VCI) diameter measurements and plethysmographic variability index- plethysmographic waveform amplitude (∆Ppleth) before sitting position and to investigate the effect of these on predicting hemodynamic changes that may develop after sitting position. Methods: Fifty-three patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery under general anesthesia, aged 18-65, ASA I-II, were included in this prospective study. Mechanical ventilation was commenced with tidal volume of 6-8 mL kg-1, 5 cm H2O of PEEP. Heart rates, blood pressure and manually measured plethysmographic waveform amplitudes were recorded and VCI-distensibility index (VCI-DI) was calculated. Measurements were repeated after performing PLRM. Correlation of hemodynamic changes, observed after patients were placed in sitting position, with VCI-DI and variations in the ∆Ppleth was evaluated. Results: After induction, VCI-DI was >18% in 19 (35.8%) of 53 patients and in 14 (73.7%) of these, VCI-DI decreased with PLRM. In 14 (93.3%) of 15 patients with ∆Ppleth >15% after induction, ∆Ppleth decreased after PLRM. The decrease in VCI-DI and ∆Ppleth with PLRM was statistically significant (p<0.001; p<0.001). Changes in VCI-DI were found to correlate with ∆Ppleth (p<0.001). When patients were placed in sitting position, there was a significant decrease in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (p=0.031; p<0.001), and a significant increase in ∆Ppleth (p<0.001). Conclusion: Plethysmographic waveform amplitude after PLRM can be used to predict the volume status and hemodynamic response of patients undergoing shoulder surgery in sitting position. © 2024 Anestezi Dergisi.

Mortality of patients with sepsis is high and largely unchanged throughout the past decades. Animal models have been widely used for the study of sepsis and septic shock, but translation into effective treatment regimes in the clinic have mostly failed. Pigs are considered as suitable research models for human diseases due to their high comparability and similarity to human anatomy, genetics, and the immune system. We here evaluated the previously reported models of septic shock in pigs and established a novel model of polymicrobial sepsis that meets the clinical criteria of septic shock in pigs. Materials and methods: The literature search was performed using the keywords “pig”, “sepsis” and “septic shock”. For the establishment of septic shock in n = 10 German landrace pigs, mechanical ventilation was initiated, central venous and arterial lines and invasive hemodynamic monitoring via pulse contour cardiac output measurement (PiCCO) established. Peritoneal polymicrobial faecal sepsis was induced by application of 3 g/kg body weight faeces into the abdominal cavity. Septic shock was defined according to the third international consensus definitions (Sepsis-3). Upon shock, pigs underwent the 1-h bundle for the treatment of human sepsis. Cytokine levels were measured by ELISA. Results: Published porcine sepsis models exhibited high methodological variability and did not meet the clinical criteria of septic shock. In our model, septic shock developed after an average of 4.8 ± 0.29 h and was associated with a reproducible drop in blood pressure (mean arterial pressure 54 ± 1 mmHg) and significant hyperlactatemia (3.76 ± 0.65 mmol/L). Septic shock was associated with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL6) and initial cardiac depression followed by a hyperdynamic phase with significant loss of systemic vascular resistance index after initial resuscitation. In addition, organ dysfunction (acute kidney injury) occurred. Conclusions: We here established a model of septic shock in pigs that meets the clinical criteria of septic shock utilized in human patients. Our model may thus serve as a reference for clinically relevant sepsis research in pigs. © 2023, The Author(s).","Animal model; Faecal peritonitis; Pig; Sepsis; Septic shock","azaperone; fentanyl; glucose; isoflurane; ketamine; meropenem; noradrenalin; propofol; vancomycin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; artificial ventilation; blood gas analysis; coinfection; colony forming unit; continuous infusion; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; kidney biopsy; lactate blood level; laparotomy; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; nonhuman; pig; sepsis; septic shock; urine volume","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160921777"

Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) is a new concept for perioperative fluid management that has been shown to improve patient prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the role of the Pleth Variability Index (PVI), systolic pressure variation (SPV), and pulse pressure variation (PPV) in maintaining tissue perfusion and renal function during GDFT management in patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Materials and Methods: Two hundred ten patients were enrolled in our prospective randomized controlled clinical trial. Demographic data, hemodynamic parameters, biochemical parameters, the amount of crystalloid and colloid fluid administered intraoperatively, and the technique of goal-directed fluid management used were recorded. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: PVI (n = 70), PPV (n = 70), and SPV (n = 70), according to the technique of goal-directed fluid management. Postoperative nausea and vomiting, time of return of bowel movement, and hospital stay duration were recorded. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between the number of crystalloids administered in all three groups. However, the amount of colloid administered was statistically significantly lower in the SPV group than in the PVI group, and there was no significant difference in the other groups. Statistically, there was no significant difference between the groups in plasma lactate, blood urea, and creatinine levels. Conclusion: In LSG, dynamic measurement techniques such as PVI, SPV, and PPV can be used in patients with morbid obesity without causing intraoperative and postoperative complications. PVI may be preferred over other invasive methods because it is noninvasive.

However, since it is measured invasively, non-invasive alternatives would be of great utility. The aim of this preliminary study was a) to investigate whether photoplethysmography (PPG) can be used to characterize venous system fluid motion and b) to find the model for venous blood volume modulations. For this purpose, we monitored the internal jugular veins using contact (cPPG) and video PPG during clinically validated physiological tests: abdominojugular test (AJT) and breath holding (BH). Video PPG and cPPG signals were captured simultaneously on the left and right sides of the neck, respectively. ECG was also captured using the same clinical monitor as cPPG. Two volunteers underwent AJT and BH with head up/down, each with: baseline (15s), experiment (15s), and recovery (15s). Video PPG was split into remote PPG (rPPG) and micromotion detection. All signal modalities were significantly affected by physiological testing. Moreover, cPPG and micromotion waveforms exhibited primary features of jugular vein waveforms and, therefore, have great potential for venous blood flow monitoring. Specifically, remote patient monitoring applications may be enabled by this methodology, facilitating physical collection without a specially trained care provider. © 2024 Optica Publishing Group (formerly OSA).

Whether PPV can be valuable for predicting FR in patients with low inspiratory effort is unknown. We aimed to investigate whether PPV can be valuable in patients with low inspiratory effort. Methods: This prospective study was conducted in an intensive care unit at a university hospital and included acute circulatory failure patients receiving volume-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breathing activity. Hemodynamic measurements were collected before and after a fluid challenge. The degree of inspiratory effort was assessed using airway occlusion pressure (P0.1) and airway pressure swing during a whole breath occlusion (ΔPocc) before fluid challenge. Patients were classified as fluid responders if their cardiac output increased by ≥ 10%. Areas under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves and gray zone approach were used to assess the predictive performance of PPV. Results: Among the 189 included patients, 53 (28.0%) were defined as responders. A PPV > 9.5% enabled to predict FR with an AUROC of 0.79 (0.67–0.83) in the whole population. The predictive performance of PPV differed significantly in groups stratified by the median value of P0.1 (P0.1 < 1.5 cmH2O and P0.1 ≥ 1.5 cmH2O), but not in groups stratified by the median value of ΔPocc (ΔPocc < − 9.8 cmH2O and ΔPocc ≥ − 9.8 cmH2O). Specifically, in patients with P0.1 < 1.5 cmH2O, PPV was associated with an AUROC of 0.90 (0.82–0.99) compared with 0.68 (0.57–0.79) otherwise (p = 0.0016). The cut-off values of PPV were 10.5% and 9.5%, respectively. Besides, patients with P0.1 < 1.5 cmH2O had a narrow gray zone (10.5–11.5%) compared to patients with P0.1 ≥ 1.5 cmH2O (8.5–16.5%).

Effects of school-based high-intensity interval training on hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability: A randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 38(6): 1033-1040, 2024 - The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a child-specific school-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) implemented into physical education (PE) classes on various hemodynamic parameters and heart rate variability indices. Forty-six students (age 11 ± 1 year) were randomized into an intervention (INT n = 22) and a control group (CON n = 24). During a 12-week period, the INT and CON groups participated in regular PE twice weekly (45-90 minutes). The INT group received HIIT during the first 20 minutes of the 2 PE classes. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total peripheral resistance, aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), heart rate, SD of normal to normal heartbeat intervals, the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD), the proportion of differences between adjacent normal to normal heartbeat intervals of more than 50 ms, low-frequency power, high-frequency power, and the LF/HF ratio were assessed before and after the experimental period. A p value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Forty students (20 INT; 20 CON) were included in the analysis. A significant time × group interaction was detected for aPWV (p = 0.05, η2= 0.099), RMSSD (p = 0.010, η2= 0.161), low-frequency power (p = 0.009, η2= 0.165), high-frequency power (p < 0.001, η2= 0.272), and the LF/HF ratio (p < 0.001, η2= 0.354). The INT group revealed significant improvements for the respective parameters. School-based HIIT can induce improvements in cardiovascular parameters. These results highlight the potential of embedding HIIT within the school setting, offering a time-efficient exercise intervention. © 2024 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

The effect of change of position on SPI, has not been studied extensively. The aim of the study was to observe the effect of prone positioning on SPI and its correlation with hemodynamic variables, in patients undergoing lumbar and thoracic spine surgery. Material and Methods: This prospective observational pilot study included 14 patients. In addition to hemodynamic monitoring, SPI, entropy and pulse pressure variability (PPV) were monitored. Propofol and Fentanyl infusions were used for maintenance of anesthesia. The patients were made prone on bolsters and all the variables were recorded every 5 minutes in supine position and after making prone for 20 minutes, before and after incision, muscle splitting and laminectomy. Results: Comparing the last value of the variables in the supine position with those immediately after making prone, SPI increased by 16.36 units (P = 0.003), followed by gradual reduction over the next 20 minutes. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate increased transiently (Pvalue = 0.028 and 0.025, respectively) without any significant change in PPV. Surgical incision also led to a significant increase in SPI. Conclusion: Prone positioning leads to significant increase in SPI, probably due to increased sympathetic tone. © 2022 Endodontology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Confounders; prone position; spine surgery; surgical pleth index","fentanyl; propofol; vecuronium; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug infusion; entropy; female; general anesthesia; hemodynamic monitoring; human; incision; laminectomy; lumbar spine; male; mean arterial pressure; observational study; pilot study; postoperative pain; prone position; prospective study; pulse pressure; spine surgery; thoracic spine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150022649"

While LV function has long been known to impact RV function, the reverse is increasingly being realized to have clinical importance. Investigating ventricular interdependence clinically is challenging given the invasive measurements required, including biventricular catheterization, and confounding factors such as comorbidities, volume status, and other aspects of subject variability. Methods: Computational modeling allows investigation of mechanical and hemodynamic interactions in the absence of these confounding factors. Here, we use a threesegment biventricular heart model and simple circulatory system to investigate ventricular interdependence under conditions of systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the LV and RV in the presence of compensatory volume loading. We use the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship, end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, Frank Starling curves, and cardiac power output as metrics. Results: The results demonstrate that LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction lead to RV compensation as indicated by increases in RV power. Additionally, RV systolic and diastolic dysfunction lead to impaired LV filling, interpretable as LV stiffening especially with volume loading to maintain systemic pressure. Discussion: These results suggest that a subset of patients with intact LV systolic function and diagnosed to have impaired LV diastolic function, categorized as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), may in fact have primary RV failure. Application of this computational approach to clinical data sets, especially for HFpEF, may lead to improved diagnosis and treatment strategies and consequently improved outcomes.

SCALE-HF 1 (Surveillance and Alert-Based Multiparameter Monitoring to Reduce Worsening Heart Failure Events) is a prospective, multicenter study that will develop and assess the accuracy of the heart function index-a composite algorithm of noninvasive hemodynamic biomarkers from a cardiac scale-in predicting worsening HF events. Methods: Approximately 300 patients with chronic HF and recent decompensation will be enrolled in this observational study for model development. Patients will be encouraged to take daily cardiac scale measurements. Results: Approximately 50 HF events, defined as an urgent, unscheduled clinic, emergency department, or hospitalization for worsening HF will be used for model development. The composite index will be developed from hemodynamic biomarkers derived from ECG, ballistocardiogram, and impedance plethysmogram signals measured from the cardiac scale. Biomarkers of interest include weight, peripheral impedance, pulse rate and variability, and estimates of stroke volume, cardiac output, and blood pressure captured through the cardiac scale. The sensitivity, unexplained alert rate, and alerting time of the index in predicting worsening HF events will be evaluated and compared with the performance of simple weight-based rule-of-thumb algorithms (eg, weight increase of 3 lbs in 1 day or 5 lbs in 7 days) that are often used in practice. Conclusions: SCALE-HF 1 is the first study to develop and evaluate the performance of a composite index derived from noninvasive hemodynamic biomarkers measured from a cardiac scale in predicting worsening HF events. Subsequent studies will validate the heart function index and assess its ability to improve patient outcomes.

Group F received 1 ml/kg BW/hour of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 6% with 5 mg/hour of furosemide and Group K received 80 ml/hour of crystalloid. Measurements and results: Demographics, clinical characteristics, albumin level, and hemodynamic profile were evaluated. The reduction of albumin levels in Group F was significantly lower than in Group K. A significant difference was found in 24th-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) (p=0.024), 15th-minute pulse rate (p=0.033), 24th-hour corrected flow time (FTc) (p=0.018), 15th-minute to 24th-hour thoracic fluid content (TFC) (p<0.05), and 24th-hour pleth variability index (PVI) (p=0.01). Giving 1 ml/kg BW of colloids and 5 mg/hour of furosemide could improve better hemodynamic profiles compared to 80 ml/hour of crystalloid based on evaluation of blood pressure, pulse rate, FTc, TFC, and PVI from non-invasive monitoring and also showed a slower reduction in plasma albumin level. This result might be due to the mechanism of fluid shifting from interstitial to plasma. However, the adverse events of hypotension still need to be cautiously monitored. Conclusion: Colloid and furosemide administration affect improvements of hemodynamic profile parameters and plasma albumin levels in parturients with pre-eclampsia. © 2022, The Indonesian Foundation of Critical Care Medicine.

We aimed to determine the effect of ANI monitor-based intraoperative nociception control on the perioperative stress response during laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position. Methods: Altogether, 72 female patients who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy were randomized to either the control or ANI group. Intraoperative nociception was controlled by remifentanil administration in a conventional manner (based on blood pressure and heart rate) in the control group and by ANI monitoring in the ANI group. Perioperative stress responses were estimated by measuring the levels of serum catecholamines and catabolic stress hormones at three timepoints: after loss of consciousness, at the end of surgery, and 1 h after the end of surgery. Results: The serum cortisol level at the end of surgery was significantly higher in the ANI group than in the control group (p < 0.001), although more remifentanil was administered in the ANI group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Changes in the other estimators’ levels were comparable between groups during the perioperative period. The hemodynamic profiles during surgery were also significantly different between the two groups. Phenylephrine use to treat hypotension was more common in the ANI group than in the control group (p = 0.005). However, postoperative clinical outcomes such as pain and nausea/vomiting did not differ between groups. Conclusion: ANI monitor-based nociception control in laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position did not improve perioperative stress responses, intraoperative opioid consumption, or postoperative clinical outcomes.

Importantly, exercise intolerance in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a key factor limiting patient quality of life and survival. Exercise intolerance in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction stems from a multi-organ failure to maintain homeostasis at rest and during exercise, including the heart, skeletal muscle, and autonomic nervous system, lending itself to a system constantly trying to ""catch-up"". Hemodynamic control during exercise is regulated primarily by the autonomic nervous system, whose operation, in turn, is partly regulated via reflexive information from exercise-stimulated receptors throughout the body (e.g., arterial baroreflex, central and peripheral chemoreceptors, and the muscle metabo- and mechanoreflexes). Persons with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction exhibit malfunctioning autonomic reflexes, which lead to exaggerated sympathoexcitation and attenuated parasympathetic tone. Chronic elevation of sympathetic activity is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. In this review, we provide an overview of how each main exercise-related autonomic reflex is changed in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and the role of exercise training in attenuating or reversing the counterproductive changes. © 2022 IMR Press Limited.

However, although BP may impact aortic dilation, aortic size may also impact BP. The causal relationship between BP and thoracic aortic size has not been reliably established. Methods: Genome-wide association studies summary statistics were obtained for BP and ascending thoracic aortic diameter (AscAoD). Causal effects of BP on AscAoD were estimated using 2-sample Mendelian randomization using a range of pleiotropy-robust methods. Results: Genetically predicted increased systolic BP, diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure all significantly associate with higher AscAoD (systolic BP: β estimate, 0.0041 mm/mm Hg [95% CI, 0.0008-0.0074]; P=0.02, diastolic BP: β estimate, 0.0272 mm/mm Hg [95% CI, 0.0224-0.0320]; P<0.001, and mean arterial pressure: β estimate, 0.0168 mm/mm Hg [95% CI, 0.0130-0.0206]; P<0.001). Genetically predicted pulse pressure, meanwhile, had an inverse association with AscAoD (β estimate, -0.0155 mm/mm Hg [95% CI, -0.0213 to -0.0096]; P<0.001). Multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses showed that genetically predicted increased mean arterial pressure and reduced pulse pressure were independently associated with AscAoD. Bidirectional Mendelian randomization demonstrated that genetically predicted AscAoD was inversely associated with pulse pressure (β estimate, -2.0721 mm Hg/mm [95% CI, -3.1137 to -1.0306]; P<0.001) and systolic BP (β estimate, -1.2878 mm Hg/mm [95% CI, -2.3533 to -0.2224]; P=0.02), while directly associated with diastolic BP (0.8203 mm Hg/mm [95% CI, 0.2735-1.3672]; P=0.004). Conclusions: BP likely contributes causally to ascending thoracic aortic dilation. Increased AscAoD likely contributes to lower systolic BP and pulse pressure, but not diastolic BP, consistent with the hemodynamic consequences of a reduced aortic diameter.  © 2023 American Heart Association, Inc.","analysis; aneurysm; aorta; blood pressure; genomics; Mendelian randomization","Blood Pressure; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; antihypertensive agent; African; African Caribbean; American; American Indian; aortic diameter; Article; ascending aorta; biobank; Black person; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; Caucasian; Central Asian; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep learning; diastolic blood pressure; East Asian; European; female; genetic linkage; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotyping; Hispanic; human; leave one out cross validation; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; Mendelian randomization analysis; Middle East; phenotype; pleiotropy; pulse pressure; quality control; sensitivity analysis; South Asian; systolic blood pressure; systolic hypertension; thoracic aorta; United Kingdom; blood pressure; genetics; hemodynamics; hypertension","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146883237"

When SGLT2i and GLP-1RA are combined, synergistic effects on BP have been observed. The mechanisms underlying these BP reductions are incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to assess the mechanisms underlying the BP reduction with the SGLT2i dapagliflozin, GLP-1RA exenatide, and dapagliflozin-exenatide compared with placebo in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Methods: Sixty-six people with type 2 diabetes were randomized to 16 weeks of dapagliflozin 10 mg/day, exenatide 10 µg twice daily, dapagliflozin-exenatide, or placebo treatment. The effect of treatments on estimates of: (1) plasma volume (calculated by Strauss formula, bioimpedance spectroscopy, hematocrit, (2) autonomic nervous system activity (heart rate variability), (3) arterial stiffness (pulse wave applanometry), (4) systemic hemodynamic parameters including peripheral vascular resistance, cardiac output and stroke volume (all derived from non-invasively systemic hemodynamic monitoring), and (5) natriuresis (24-hour urine collection) were assessed after 10 days and 16 weeks of treatment. Results: After 10 days, dapagliflozin reduced systolic BP (SBP) by − 4.7 mmHg, and reduced plasma volume. After 16 weeks, dapagliflozin reduced SBP by − 4.4 mmHg, and reduced sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. Exenatide had no effect on SBP, but reduced parasympathetic nervous system activity after 10 days and 16 weeks. After 10 days, dapagliflozin-exenatide reduced SBP by − 4.2 mmHg, and reduced plasma volume. After 16 weeks, dapagliflozin-exenatide reduced SBP by − 6.8 mmHg, and the reduction in plasma volume was still observed, but SNS activity was unaffected. Conclusions: The dapagliflozin-induced plasma volume contraction may contribute to the initial SBP reduction, while a reduction in SNS activity may contribute to the persistent SBP reduction. Dapagliflozin-exenatide resulted in the largest decrease in SBP. The effect on plasma volume was comparable to dapagliflozin monotherapy, and SNS activity was not reduced, therefore other mechanisms are likely to contribute to the blood pressure lowering effect of this combination, which need further investigation.

However, the influence of exercise on these hemodynamic parameters is unknown among patients with resistant hypertension. The EnRicH (The Exercise Training in the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension) was a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial (NCT03090529). Sixty patients were randomized to a 12-week aerobic exercise program or usual care. The outcome measures include central BP, BP variability, heart rate variability, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and circulating cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, angiotensin II, superoxide dismutase, interferon gamma, nitric oxide, and endothelial progenitor cells. Central systolic BP decreased by 12.22 mm Hg (95% CI, −1.88 to −22.57, P = 0.022) as did BP variability by 2.85 mm Hg (95% CI, −4.91 to −0.78, P = 0.008), in the exercise (n = 26) compared to the control group (n = 27). Interferon gamma −4.3 pg/mL (95%CI, −7.1 to −1.5, P = 0.003), angiotensin II −157.0 pg/mL (95%CI, −288.1 to −25.9, P = 0.020), and superoxide dismutase 0.4 pg/mL (95%CI, 0.1–0.6, P = 0.009) improved in the exercise compared to the control group. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, heart rate variability, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, nitric oxide, and endothelial progenitor cells were not different between groups (P > 0.05). In conclusion, a 12-week exercise training program improved central BP and BP variability, and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers in patients with resistant hypertension. These markers are clinically relevant as they are associated with target organ damage and increased cardiovascular disease risk and mortality.

When using a pulmonary artery catheter, pulse pressure variation and systolic pressure variation can be calculated from right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressure waveforms. Methods: We conducted a prospective interventional study investigating the ability of right ventricular pulse pressure variation (PPVRV) and systolic pressure variation (SPVRV) as well as pulmonary artery pulse pressure variation (PPVPA) and systolic pressure variation (SPVPA) to predict fluid responsiveness in coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery patients. Additionally, radial artery pulse pressure variation (PPVART) and systolic pressure variation (SPVART) were calculated. The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve with 95%-confidence interval (95%-CI) was used to assess the capability to predict fluid responsiveness (defined as an increase in cardiac index of > 15%) after a 500 mL crystalloid fluid challenge. Results: Thirty-three patients were included in the final analysis. Thirteen patients (39%) were fluid-responders with a mean increase in cardiac index of 25.3%. The AUROC was 0.60 (95%-CI 0.38 to 0.81) for PPVRV, 0.63 (95%-CI 0.43 to 0.83) for SPVRV, 0.58 (95%-CI 0.38 to 0.78) for PPVPA, and 0.71 (95%-CI 0.52 to 0.89) for SPVPA. The AUROC for PPVART was 0.71 (95%-CI 0.53 to 0.89) and for SPVART 0.78 (95%-CI 0.62 to 0.94). The correlation between pulse pressure variation and systolic pressure variation measurements derived from the different waveforms was weak.

Here we examined how abdominal fat content, as judged by waist:height ratio, influenced blood pressure and hemodynamic profile in normotensive subjects and never-treated hypertensive patients. Methods: The 541 participants (20–72 years) underwent physical examination and laboratory analyses and were divided into age and sex-adjusted quartiles of waist:height ratio. Supine hemodynamics were recorded using whole-body impedance cardiography, combined with analyses of radial tonometric pulse wave form and heart rate variability. Results: Mean waist:height ratios in the quartiles were 0.46, 0.51, 0.55 and 0.62. Radial and aortic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulse wave velocity, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, leptin levels and C-reactive protein were higher in quartile 4 when compared with quartiles 1 and 2 (p < 0.05 for all). Cardiac index was lower in quartile 4 versus quartile 1, while no differences were seen in heart rate variability, augmentation index, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone concentration between the quartiles. Linear regression analyses showed independent associations of abdominal obesity with higher aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and pulse wave velocity (p < 0.05 for waist:height ratio in all regression models). Conclusion: Higher waist:height ratio was associated with elevated blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and arterial stiffness, but not with alterations in cardiac sympathovagal modulation or activation of the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although obesity-related elevation of blood pressure has distinct phenotypic features, these results suggest that its main characteristics correspond those of primary hypertension.

CRI is a computational algorithm that has been broadly applied to non-invasively estimate hemodynamic vascular adaptations during acute blood loss. So far, there is a lack of baseline values from healthy individuals, which complicates accurately estimating the severity of the hemodynamic compromise. Additionally, the application of this technology in pediatric populations is limited to a few reports, highlighting a marked variability by age, weight, and other physiological parameters. The CRI of 205 healthy subjects from 0 to 60 years of age were prospectively evaluated from January to February 2020 at several public outpatient clinics in El Salvador; vital signs and sociodemographic data were also collected during this period. After data collection, baseline values were classified for each age group. Multiple correlation models were tested between the CRI and the other physiological parameters. CRI value varies significantly for each age group, finding for patients under 18 years old a mean value lower than 0.6, which is currently considered the lower normal limit for adults. CRI presents strong correlations with other physiological variables such as age, weight, estimated blood volume, and heart rate (R > 0.8, R2 > 0.6, p < 0.0001). There is significant variability in the CRI normal values observed in healthy patients based on age, weight, estimated blood volume, and heart rate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Compensatory reserve index; Machine learning; Normal values; Predictive algorithm","Adolescent; Adult; Blood Pressure; Blood Volume; Child; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Vital Signs; oxygen; adolescent; adult; age; Article; bleeding; blood vessel function; blood volume; body surface; body weight; child; cohort analysis; compensatory reserve index; correlation analysis; El Salvador; female; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; human; infant; male; non invasive measurement; normal human; outpatient department; oxygen saturation; preschool child; prospective study; pulse oximetry; school child; sociodemographics; technology; vital sign; volunteer; blood pressure; blood volume; hemodynamics; physiology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116049161"

We hypothesized that (co-)authors of PDA-related papers were more likely to screen for a PDA and would treat earlier and more aggressively. An international internet-based survey between September 2019 and March 2020 in which we collected (1) baseline characteristics; (2) availability of guidelines; (3) screening strategy for PDA; (4) diagnostic criteria for hemodynamic significance; (5) treatment strategy; and (6) metrics of treatment efficacy. Finally, ten clinical equipoise statements were posed on a Likert scale. In total, 144 surveys were sent, of which 71/144 (49%) surveys could be analyzed with 56/71 (79%) fully completed surveys. The respondents, mainly neonatologists in a level III neonatal intensive care unit, of whom 36/71 (51%) had (co-)authored a publication on the PDA, highlighted a lack of national guidelines, heterogeneous approach to screening strategies, and marked variability in diagnostic criteria to assess hemodynamic significance, treatment strategies and effect measurement. No major significant differences were observed between respondents who did or did not (co-)author a publication on the PDA. Respondents who screened for PDA scored significantly higher on the need for screening, early and aggressive treatment. Remarkably, the scores of all statements regarding clinical equipoise varied widely. Conclusions: Our survey highlights the lack of guidelines and enormous heterogeneity in current practice. Current evidence is not robust enough to harmonize current treatment strategies into (inter)national guidelines.What is Known:• Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) incidence is inversely related to gestational age.• Although early pharmacological treatment induces PDA closure, optimal treatment is debated due to the lack of beneficial effects on outcome.What is New:• In the absence of (inter)national guidelines, diagnostic and treatment strategies are heterogeneous and contradictory, even in a selected hemodynamically- interested group.• Different PDA screening strategies did, while PDA publication status did not, show significant differences in treatment strategy and responses to equipoise statements. © 2022, The Author(s).","Conservative approach; Ibuprofen; Morbidity; Mortality; PDA; Placebo","Consensus; Ductus Arteriosus, Patent; Humans; Ibuprofen; Indomethacin; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Surveys and Questionnaires; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; ibuprofen; indometacin; inotropic agent; lactic acid; paracetamol; surfactant; ibuprofen; indometacin; aorta; arterial pressure; Article; birth weight; blood flow; blood flow velocity; cardiologist; celiac artery; congenital heart disease; consensus; continuous positive airway pressure; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; ductus arteriosus obliteration; echocardiography; echography; enteric feeding; equipoise; extubation; follow up; Germany; gestational age; heart hemodynamics; heart left atrium; heart left right shunt; heart left ventricle enddiastolic diameter; heart murmur; heart output; human; infant; kidney disease; kidney failure; lactate blood level; left pulmonary artery; Likert scale; loading drug dose; lung edema; major clinical study; mean arterial pressure; medical literature; middle cerebral artery; mitral valve; near infrared spectroscopy; neonatal intensive care unit; neonatologist; Netherlands; outpatient department; oxygen consumption; palliative therapy; patent ductus arteriosus; patient assessment; pediatric cardiology; peer review; Poland; practice guideline; prematurity; publication; pulmonary vein; pulse pressure; screening; superior cava vein; superior mesenteric artery; tachypnea; thorax radiography; treatment outcome; Turkey (republic); work experience; consensus; newborn; patent ductus arteriosus; prematurity; questionnaire","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126757732"

In the present study, we aimed to find independent clinical predictors of VO2-max by use of multiple measurements of cardiac, respiratory and vascular variables collected while resting. Methods: In the Prospective study of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM), 420 subjects aged 50 years were investigated regarding endothelial function, arterial compliance, heart rate variability, arterial blood flow and atherosclerosis, left ventricular structure and function, lung function, multiple blood pressure measurements, lifestyle habits, body composition and in addition a maximal bicycle exercise test with gas exchange (VO2 and VCO2). Results: When VO2-max (indexed for lean mass) was used as the dependent variable and the 84 hemodynamic or metabolic variables were used as independent variables in separate sex-adjusted models, 15 variables showed associations with p < 0.00064 (Bonferroni-adjusted). Eight independent variables explained 21% of the variance in VO2-max. Current smoking and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were the two major determinants of VO2-max (explaining each 7% and 3% of the variance; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.008, respectively). They were in order followed by vital capacity, fat mass, pulse pressure, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. The relationships were inverse for all these variables, except for vital capacity and HDL. Conclusion: Several metabolic, cardiac, respiratory and vascular variables measured at rest explained together with smoking 21% of the variation in VO2-max in middle-aged individuals. Of those variables, smoking and PWV were the most important. © 2022 The Authors.

However, few of these PSG data are incorporated into standard reports, and hence, ultimately, under-utilized in clinical decision making. Recently, there has been substantial interest regarding novel alternative PSG metrics that may help to predict obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)–related outcomes better than standard PSG metrics such as the apnea-hypopnea index. We systematically review the recent literature for studies that examined the use of alternative PSG metrics in the context of OSA and their association with health outcomes. Methods: We systematically searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for studies published between 2000 and 2022 for those that reported alternative metrics derived from PSG in adults and related them to OSA-related outcomes. Results: Of the 186 initial studies identified by the original search, data from 31 studies were ultimately included in the final analysis. Numerous metrics were identified that were significantly related to a broad range of outcomes. We categorized the outcomes into 2 main subgroups: (1) cardiovascular/metabolic outcomes and mortality and (2) cognitive function– and vigilance-related outcomes. Four general categories of alternative metrics were identified based on signals analyzed: autonomic/hemodynamic metrics, electroencephalographic metrics, oximetric metrics, and respiratory event–related metrics. Conclusions: We have summarized the current landscape of literature for alternative PSG metrics relating to risk prediction in OSA. Although promising, further prospective observational studies are needed to verify findings from other cohorts, and to assess the clinical utility of these metrics. © 2023 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is indirectly computed using PTT. We conducted a study using ECG, Pressure, and PPG sensor to capture the PAT and PTT information noninvasively. Three PAT and three PTT values were obtained from the body. An electrocardiograph (ECG/EKG) is used as a reference signal for three PAT values. PTT values were obtained using pressure and PPG sensors connected at the wrist and fingertip respectively. A pressure sensor module was constructed to measure PTT at the wrist and the results were compared with the other standard reference values. Heart rate variability was found to be relatively lower in both ECG and PPG sensors as compared with pressure sensors at the wrist. The PAT obtained from ECG and PPG sensor was found to have the least variation of 0.386±0.037 sec with 9.58% of the variation. PTT at the wrist captured using a pressure sensor was recorded to be 0.026±0.013 sec with 50% of the variation. PTT values measured using ECG and pressure sensor were found to be correlating with ECG and PPG. The experimental result indicates different ranges of the PWV which indicates that the flow velocity of the blood varies with different arteries. PTT can be effectively computed from pressure and PPG sensors, and this makes it possible to extract different pulse features in the wearable devices without the need of ECG signal or PAT as reference. © 2023 The Authors","Artery; Pressure; Pulse; Sensor; Signal; Wrist","adult; Article; body height; body weight; controlled study; correlation analysis; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiogram; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; pressure measurement; pulse arrival time; pulse transit time; pulse wave velocity; QRS amplitude; radial artery; signal processing; systolic blood pressure; validation process; wrist circumference","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85148646654"

This article presents a literature review on some pathophysiological features of children with cancer and data from our own observations. Pediatric cancer patients undergo many surgeries and procedures, so knowledge of all the features of the child’s body before anesthesia will determine their intraope-rative stability and minimize possible complications. Anes thetic care for infants and children with oncology requires increased attention to the physiological and psychological chan ges that occur as a result of their disease and treatment. This requires a periope-rative approach other than in children with non-cancerous patho-logy. Consequently, our purpose was to assess the initial state of hemodynamics, autonomic nervous system, stress response and inflammatory response in children with cancer in the preoperative period. Materials and methods. We examined 49 children with oncological pathology aged 9.02 ± 6.05 years, who were treated at the Dnipro Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital of DRC in 2019–2021. To compare the studied parameters, a group of children preparing to the elective surgical treatment for traumatic pathology was additionally examined; it included 49 patients of similar age. Parameters of hemodynamics (heart rate, systolic, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance) were studied. The activity of the autonomic nervous system was mea-sured based on heart rate variability. In addition to the number of circulating blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, platelets, the levels of cortisol, C-reactive protein, interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor α were determined. Results. The preoperative condition of children with cancer differs a little from that of patients with trauma pathology, both in terms of clinical blood tests and hemodynamic parameters. The profile of stress responses to future surgical treatment was more pronounced in children with oncology, as evidenced by a persistent surge in cortisol and reduced levels of very low-frequency components of cardiointervalogram. And an increase in proinflammatory cyto-kines can be explained by the presence of chronic inflammation in children with cancer. Conclusions. Future anesthesia regimens should optimize the modulation of stress responses, and for its safety it is important to find accurate markers of possible distress in pediatric patients. © 2022.

Seventy-two patients who underwent spine surgery with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) were randomly categorized into the remimazolam group (group R) or propofol group (group P). On the first postoperative day, the QoR-15 scores for groups P and R were 114 and 112, respectively, indicating no significant difference (p = 0.691). Similarly, group–time interaction effects on QoR-15 scores were not significantly different. In the post-anesthesia care unit, the pain intensity at rest was notably higher in group P than in group R (3.0 [0.0] vs. 2.8 [0.5], respectively, p = 0.009). Although the intraoperative consumption of remifentanil was higher in group R (1452.4 µg vs. 2066.8 µg, respectively, p < 0.001), the intraoperative use of vasopressors was lower in group R (1705.6 µg vs. 286.1 µg, respectively, p < 0.001) compared to group P. Group R exhibited significantly lower variability in mean blood pressure over time compared to group P. Remimazolam was viewed as a promising intravenous agent for general anesthesia, showing potential to replace propofol in spine surgery with IONM, considering both recovery quality and intraoperative hemodynamic stability. © 2024 by the authors.","intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring; propofol; quality of recovery; remimazolam; total intravenous anesthesia","dexmedetomidine; fentanyl; glycopyrronium; hypertensive factor; lidocaine; midazolam; morphine; nefopam; neostigmine; neuromuscular blocking agent; palonosetron; phenylephrine; propofol; ramosetron; remifentanil; remimazolam; rocuronium; steroid; sufentanil; tramadol; adult; aged; anesthesia induction; article; Article; blood pressure; body mass; cervical myelopathy; chi square test; comorbidity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; double blind procedure; drug administration; electrocardiography; extubation; female; Fisher exact test; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; inhalational drug administration; intervertebral disk hernia; intravenous drug administration; ligament calcinosis; major clinical study; male; medical ethics; nausea and vomiting; neurophysiological monitoring; numeric rating scale; outcome assessment; physical activity; postanesthesia care; postoperative complication; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; prospective study; psychiatry; pulse oximetry; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; recovery room; sedation; sleep disorder; smoking; spine surgery; statistical analysis; stenosis; Student t test; surgical infection; ulnar nerve; unconsciousness; vomiting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191728691"

Endothelial dysfunction plays a relevant role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular disease and appears to underlie many of the complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, to what degree this persists after recovery is unknown.Methods:Individuals previously hospitalized with COVID-19, those recovered from mild symptoms and seronegative controls with well known risk factors for endothelial dysfunction were studied. To assess the involvement of nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway (NO-cGMP) on PWRS, sildenafil was also administrated in a subsample.Results:One hundred and one participants (60 men) aged 47.8±14.1 (mean±SD) years of whom 33 were previously hospitalized with COVID-19 were recruited. Salbutamol had minimal effect on haemodynamics including blood pressure and heart rate. It reduced AIx in controls (n=34) and those recovered from mild symptoms of COVID-19 (n=34) but produced an increase in AIx in those previously hospitalized: mean change [95% confidence interval]-2.85 [-5.52,-0.188] %,-2.32 [-5.17,0.54] %, and 3.03 [0.06, 6.00] % for controls, those recovered from mild symptoms and those previously hospitalized, respectively (P=0.001). In a sub-sample (n=22), sildenafil enhanced PWRS (change in AIx 0.05 [-2.15,2.24] vs.-3.96 [-7.01.-2.18], P=0.006) with no significant difference between hospitalized (n=12) and nonhospitalized participants (n=10).Conclusions:In patients previously hospitalized with COVID-19, there is long-lasting impairment of endothelial function as measured by the salbutamol-induced stimulation of the NO-cGMP pathway that may contribute to cardiovascular complications. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Therefore, we analysed the daily variability of pulse pressure, the maximum value of acceleration rate of aortic pressure (dP/dt(max)) measured by telemetry and protein expression in the thoracic aorta of normotensive male rats exposed to ALAN (1–2 lx) for 3 weeks. Daily, 24-h variability of pulse pressure and dP/dt(max) was observed during a regular light/dark regimen with higher values during the dark compared to the light phase of the day. ALAN suppressed 24-h variability and enhanced ultradian (<12-h) periods of pulse pressure and dP/dt(max) in duration-dependent manners. From beat-to-beat blood pressure variability, ALAN decreased low-frequency bands (a sympathetic marker) and had minimal effects on high-frequency bands. At the molecular level, ALAN decreased angiotensin II receptor type 1 expression and reduced 24-h variability. ALAN caused the appearance of 12-h oscillations in transforming growth factor β1 and fibulin 4. Expression of sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase type 2 was increased in the middle of the light and dark phase of the day, and ALAN did not affect its daily and 12-h variability. In conclusion, ALAN suppressed 24-h variability of pulse pressure and dP/dt(max), decreased the power of low-frequency bands and differentially affected the expression of specific proteins in the rat thoracic aorta. Suppressed 24-h oscillations by ALAN underline the pulsatility of individual endocrine axes with different periods, disrupting the cardiovascular control of central blood pressure.

This study aimed to determine whether a single session of SMR could impact cardiovascular parameters at rest and during a cold pressor test (CPT). Methods: Twenty male participants (aged 26 ± 2 years) underwent a 20-min SMR and a 20-min seated control condition (CON) on two separate test days in a randomized order. Peripheral and central blood pressure (BP), total peripheral resistance (TPR), pulse wave velocity (PWV), heart rate (HR), root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD), and the quotient of low-frequency power and high-frequency power (LF/HF) were measured both at rest and during a CPT before (t0), 2 min (t1), and 20 min (t2) after the SMR and CON. Results: Time × condition interactions could be detected for peripheral and central diastolic BP, TPR, HR, and RMSSD. Following the SMR, peripheral diastolic BP, central diastolic BP, TPR, and RMSSD were reduced, while HR was increased compared to the CON. Regarding the CPT time × condition interactions could be detected for peripheral, and central diastolic BP, with lower values after SMR. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that a single bout of SMR confers favorable cardiovascular benefits in healthy normotensive individuals. Furthermore, SMR can attenuate the hemodynamic reactivity to a stress test. Future research should address whether regular SMR leads to chronic adaptations similar to regular, moderate aerobic exercise, massage therapy, and static stretching. © The Author(s) 2023.","Blood pressure; Cold pressor test; Foam roller; Heart rate variability; Pain perception","Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Heart; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Massage; Rest; adult; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; controlled study; heart; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; male; massage; physiology; procedures; randomized controlled trial; rest","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180860596"

Central BP measures taken over a 24-hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) adds prognostic value in assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared with brachial BP measures from a single time point. We assessed CVD risk between adults with and without a history of COVID-19 via appraisal of 24-hour brachial and central hemodynamic load from ABPM. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on 32 adults who tested positive for COVID-19 (29 ± 13 years, 22 females) and 43 controls (28 ± 12 years, 26 females). Measures of 24-hour hemodynamic load included brachial and central systolic and diastolic BP, pulse pressure, augmentation index (AIx), pulse wave velocity (PWV), nocturnal BP dipping, the ambulatory arterial stiffness index (AASI), and the blood pressure variability ratio (BPVR). RESULTS: Participants who tested positive for COVID-19 experienced 6 ± 4 COVID-19 symptoms, were studied 122 ± 123 days after testing positive, and had mild-to-moderate COVID-19 illness. The results from independent samples t-tests showed no significant differences in 24-hour, daytime, or nighttime measures of central or peripheral hemodynamic load across those with and without a history of COVID-19 (P > 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: No differences in 24-hour brachial or central ABPM measures were detected between adults recovering from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and controls without a history of COVID-19. Adults recovering from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 do not have increased 24-hour central hemodynamic load.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Apart from primary symptoms, depressed patients often have a higher cardiovascular risk profile. Multimodal therapy concepts, including exercise, have emerged as promising approaches that not only improve depressive symptoms but also have a positive impact on cardiovascular risk profile. However, controversies have arisen concerning the influence of baseline severity on the effects of therapy concepts for this demographic. This study assessed whether pretreatment severity moderates psychological and physiological treatment outcomes of a multimodal therapy. A total of 16 patients diagnosed with mild depression (MD) and 14 patients diagnosed with severe depression (SD) took part in a 3-month outpatient multimodal treatment therapy. Before and after the treatment, depression score (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)), peripheral systolic (pSBP) and diastolic (pDBP) blood pressure, central systolic (cSBP) and diastolic (cDBP) blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV), heart rate (HR), and parasympathetic parameters of heart rate variability (RMSSD) were assessed. Significant time effects were detected for BDI (−20.0 ± 11.6, p > 0.001, η2 = 0.871), pSBP (−4.7 ± 6.8 mmHg, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.322), pDBP (−3.5 ± 6.9 mmHg, p = 0.01, η2 = 0.209), cSBP (−4.8 ± 6.5 mmHg, p < 0.001, η2 = 0.355), cDBP (−3.6 ± 6.8 mmHg, p = 0.008, η2 = 0.226), PWV (−0.13 ± 0.23 m/s, p = 0.008, η2 = 0.229), HR (4.3 ± 8.8 min−1, p = 0.015, η2 = 0.193), RMSSD (−12.2 ± 23.9 ms, p = 0.017, η2 = 0.251), and and SDNN (10.5 ± 17.8 ms, p = 0.005, η2 = 0.330). Significant time × group interaction could be revealed for BDI (p < 0.001, η2 = 0.543), with patients suffering from SD showing stronger reductions.

Objective: To evaluate the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation on central hemodynamic parameters and autonomic activity in obese/overweight individuals with low vitamin D levels (<30ng/dl). Methods: Adults 40-65 years old with body mass index ≥25<40 kg/m² were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial (NCT 05689632). Central hemodynamics was assessed using the oscillometric method (Mobil-O-Graph®), and heart rate variability using a Polar heart rate monitor (Kubios® software). Patients (n=53) received a placebo in the control group (CO, n=25) or vitamin D3 (VD, n=28) 7000 IU/day, and were evaluated before (W0) and after 8 weeks (W8) with a significance level of 0.05. Results: The groups were homogeneous regarding age (51±6 vs 52±6 years, p=0.509) and vitamin D levels (22.8±4.9 vs 21.7±4.5ng/ml, p=0.590). At W8, the VD group had significantly higher levels of vitamin D (22.5 vs 35.6ng/ml, p<0.001). Only the VD group showed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP; 123±15 vs 119±14mmHg, p=0.019) and alkaline phosphatase (213±55 vs 202±55mg/dl, p=0.012). The CO group showed an increase in augmentation pressure (AP: 9 vs 12 mmHg, p=0.028) and augmentation index (AIx: 26 vs 35%, p=0.020), which was not observed in the VD group (AP: 8 vs 8 mmHg, AIx: 26 vs 25%, p>0.05).

An emergence of applanation tonometry made it possible to evaluate arterial stiffness and central hemodynamic parameters non-invasively, which considerably expanded the information that had been provided previously by invasive methods used for studying these parameters during cardiac catheterization. Whereas a few studies have assessed central aortic pressure (CAP) parameters and reflected pulse wave in women at different phases of their reproductive aging, none investigated the daily profile of CAP and reflected pulse wave parameters in women undergoing different stages of the menopause. Background: assessment of the daily variability in CAP and daily profile of amplification and augmentation of pulse blood pressure (PBP) in women at different menopause phases. Methods: The study involved 384 climacteric women. The first group included 168 women undergoing perimenopause, the second group comprised of 216 women in their early postmenopausal stage. A 24-h blood pressure (BP) monitoring in the brachial artery and aorta (BPLab® Vasotens® system, Petr Telegin LLC, Russia) was performed via the measurements of the following indicators: systolic blood pressure (SBP), pulse blood pressure (PBP), central aortic systolic pressure (CASP), central aortic pulse pressure (CAPP), aortic augmentation index (AIxao), and pulse pressure amplification (PPA). Results: When investigating PPA values in the brachial artery and aorta, we detected smaller amplification and higher aortic augmentation index at night than in daytime, which reflected a disproportionately higher CAP level during night hours. This pattern was more pronounced in postmenopausal women. We calculated the logistic regression equation (adjusted R2 = 0.49, log-likelihood = − 50.3, chi-square (19) = 97.6, p < 0.001), in which dependent variable was represented by the menopausal status, whereas body mass index with all indicators of a 24-h BP monitoring represented independent variables. In this model, two indicators (body mass index and AIxao) were, independently of each other, associated significantly with the menopause phases. Differences among women at various climacteric phases in terms of remaining indicators of a 24-h BP monitoring, apparently, matched the differences in their body mass index values. Conclusion: Rising CAP, in combination with declining PPA and augmenting reflected pulse wave amplitude, may be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Arterial stiffness; Augmentation index; Central aortic pressure; Menopause; Pulse pressure amplification","Antihypertensive Agents; Aorta; Arterial Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Brachial Artery; Female; Heart Disease Risk Factors; Humans; Hypertension; Menopause; Middle Aged; Perimenopause; Postmenopause; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulse Wave Analysis; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Vascular Stiffness; antihypertensive agent; adult; aortic augmentation index; aortic pressure; aortic pulse wave velocity; Article; blood pressure monitoring; body mass; brachial pressure; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; central aortic pressure; central aortic pulse pressure; central aortic systolic pressure; climacterium; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; middle aged; postmenopause; priority journal; pulse pressure; scoring system; systolic blood pressure; aorta; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; blood pressure monitoring; brachial artery; climacterium; comparative study; drug effect; hypertension; menopause; pathophysiology; predictive value; pulse wave; risk assessment; time factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106296014"

Methods Prospective and observational study was performed in the patients with septic shock admitted to the Fourth Department of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Fujian Provincial Hospital from July 2019 to July 2020. Subclavian venous catheter was indwelled in each patient, then the hemodynamic parameters including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac output (CO) and pulse pressure variability (PPV) were measured non-invasively by CNAP before and after PLR and volume expansion (VE) test. The changes of CO during PLR test (ΔCOPLR) and VE test (ΔCOVE) were calculated respectively. Patients were classified as responder group or non-responder group according to the ΔCOVE increased ≥15% or not after VE test. Moreover, Pearson's test was used for the correlation analysis. The roles of ΔCOPLR and PPV before VE test in predicting volume responsiveness were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results A total of 40 VE tests in these 36 patients were evaluated and resulting in 18 responder group and 22 non-responder group. There was no significant difference between two groups in the hemodynamics parameters before PLR and VE test (P>0.05). Both in responder group and non-responder group, there was no significant change in HR and MAP after PLR and VE test (P>0.05). After PLR, CVP did not change significantly in the two groups (P>0.05). CVP after VE test increased significantly in the two groups (P<0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). CO was obviously increased after PLR and VE test in the two groups (P<0.05). In responder group, CO after PLR and VE test were significantly higher than those in non-responder group [(6.01±1.28) L/min vs. (5.16±1.22) L/min, (6.31±1.33) L/min vs. (5.15±1.39) L/min, P<0.05]. Besides, the ΔCOPLR and ΔCOVE in responder group were significantly higher than those in non-responder group (21.21%±8.54% vs. 10.76%±4.94%, 26.32%±8.64% vs. 9.44%±3.45%, P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed that the ΔCOPLR was positively related to ΔCOVE (r=0.820, P<0.05), while the PPV before VE test was unrelated to ΔCOVE (r=0.194, P>0.05). Furthermore, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ΔCOPLR and PPV predicting volume responsiveness were 0.855 (95%CI 0.707-0.946, P<0.05) and 0.525 (95%CI 0.362-0.685, P>0.05) respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of ΔCOPLR ≥13.95% to predict volume responsiveness in patients with septic shock were 83.3% and 81.8%, respectively. Conclusion ΔCOPLR measured by CNAP can predict the volume responsiveness in patients with septic shock and it is reliable to guide further fluid resuscitation. © 2021 People's Military Medical Press.

BP variability (BPV) is another important factor, along with the effects of HTN on the vasculature. The concept of systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome (SHATS) has been proposed, describing an age-related and synergistic vicious cycle of hemodynamic stress and vascular disease. The importance of SHATS is based on the assumption that the assessment of BPV and arterial disease is likely to provide an effective opportunity to intervene early to reduce progression to HTN in younger patients or to CVD events and organ damage in older patients. In addition to providing an overview of current evidence for the mechanisms and clinical data related to SHATS, this article proposes a new SHATS score for use to diagnose and assess the severity of SHATS. The score includes two components – a BP score and a vascular score – which are multiplied to generate the SHATS score. This reflects the synergistic, rather than additive, effects of BP and vascular disease on target organ damage and CVD events. Although it requires refinement and validation in future studies, early detection of SHATS using tools such as the proposed score, combined with population-based stratification and technology-based anticipation medicine incorporating real-time individual data, has the potential to contribute to meaningful reductions in rates of CVD events and target organ damage. © 2019","Blood pressure control; Blood pressure variability; Morning hypertension; Nocturnal hypertension; Synergistic resonance; Systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome (SHATS)","Atherosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Humans; Hypertension; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Syndrome; Thrombosis; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; human; hypertension; pathophysiology; prognosis; risk factor; severity of illness index; syndrome; thrombosis","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076350525"

Methods Forty-eight elderly patients, aged ≥ 65 yr, with body mass index of 18-30 kg/m2, of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status II or III, scheduled for elective spinal surgery, were enrolled. Patients were mechanically ventilated using a volume-controlled mode with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight during operation. A radial arterial catheter was inserted and connected to FloTrac/Vigileo system to monitor hemodynamic parameters. At 5 min after prone position, volume expansion was started when the hemodynamics was stable; lactated Ringer's solution 1 ml/kg was intravenously infused over 1 min, 1 min later lactated Ringer's solution 1 ml/kg was intravenously infused over 1 min, 1 min later lactated Ringer's solution 1 ml/kg was intravenously infused over 1 min, and 1 min later operation was started. After tracheal intubation and before prone position (T1), 5 min of prone position (T2), 1 min after 1st infusion of 1 ml/kg liquid (T3), and 1 min after 2nd infusion of 1 ml/kg liquid (T4) and 1 min after infusion of 3 ml/kg fluid (T5), heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, stroke volume index (SVI), stroke volume variability (SVV), pulse pressure variability (PPV), and changes in SVI induced by rapid infusion of 1, 2 and 5 ml/kg crystalloid (ΔSVI1 ml/kg, ΔSVI2 ml/kg, ΔSVI5 ml/kg) were calculated. Positive fluid challenges were defined as an increase in SVI of 10% or more from baseline, and the patients were divided into responder group (R) and non-responder group (NR). Receiver operating characteristic curves predicting fluid responsiveness were generated for ΔSVI1 ml/kg, ΔSVI2 ml/kg, SVV and PPV, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated. Results Thirty patients were enrolled in group R and 18 cases in group NR. The AUC of ΔSVI1 ml/kgin predicting fluid volume responsiveness was 0.87 with a diagnostic threshold of 7%, a sensitivity of 80%, and a specificity of 83%. The AUC of ΔSVI2 ml/kgin predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.928 with a diagnostic threshold of 8%, a sensitivity of 78%, and a specificity of 89%. The AUC of SW and PPV in predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.65 and 0.53, respectively. Conclusion Mini-fluid challenge test guided by ΔSVI can predict fluid responsiveness in elderly patients undergoing surgery in prone position, and rapid infusion of 2 ml/kg crystalloid provides better accuracy than 1 ml/kg. © 2021 Chinese Journal of Medical Genetics.All rights reserved.","Aged; Fluid therapy; Prone position; Vascular capacitance","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132936474"

Impaired arterial baroreflex control is suggested to play an important role in cardiovascular autonomic imbalance, often seen in obesity. We previously demonstrated that cafeteria diets increase the sympathetic drive to white and brown adipose tissue. Methods and results: After feeding a cafeteria diet to rats for 26 days, we evaluated: (i)heart rate (HR) and arterial pressure (AP); (ii)baroreflex and chemoreflex function; and (iii) autonomic modulation of the heart and vessels, measured through pulse interval (PI) and systolic arterial pressure (SAP) variability analyses and following administration of autonomic blockers. The cafeteria diet increased body fat mass and serum insulin, leptin, triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels. Baseline HR (15%) was also increased, accompanied by increased power in the low frequency band (60%) and in the low frequency/high frequency ratio (104%) in the PI spectra. Nonlinear analysis revealed an increased occurrence of 0V (39%) and decreased occurrence of 2UV (18%) patterns. Following administration of autonomic blockers, we observed an increase in cardiac sympathetic tone (425%) in cafeteria diet-fed rats. The cafeteria diet had no effect on AP, SAP variability, baroreflex and chemoreflex control. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that consumption of a cafeteria diet increases sympathetic drive to the heart but not to the blood vessels, independent of impairment in baroreflex and chemoreflex functions. Other mechanisms may be involved in the increased cardiac sympathetic drive, and compensatory vascular mechanisms may prevent the development of hypertension in this model of obesity. © 2020 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","Autonomic nervous system; Cardiovascular disease; Heart rate variability; Obesity","Animals; Arterial Pressure; Baroreflex; Chemoreceptor Cells; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Intake; Heart; Heart Rate; Male; Obesity; Rats, Wistar; Sympathetic Nervous System; Time Factors; cholesterol; insulin; leptin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; arterial pressure; Article; body fat; bradycardia; brown adipose tissue; cafeteria diet; caloric intake; chemoreceptor reflex; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fat mass; feeding behavior; Fourier transform; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; hypertension; hypotension; lipid diet; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; parasympathetic tone; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; rat; sympathetic tone; systolic blood pressure; adrenergic system; animal; caloric intake; chemoreceptor cell; diet; disease model; heart; heart rate; innervation; metabolism; obesity; pathophysiology; time factor; Wistar rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082744228"

To study the main indicators of 24-hour blood pressure (BP) monitoring and the functional state of blood vessels in perimenopausal women with arterial hypertension (AH) depending on the hemodynamic phenotype, as well as their dynamics in complex treatment with vitamin D status correction. Materials and methods. There were examined 92 women with AH of the stage II and risk 3 in the perimenopause period, represented by equal subgroups on vitamin D status: with a normal plasma level of total 25 (OH)D (1) and its deficiency/insufficiency (2). All patients received unified antihypertensive therapy; the subgroup 2 received cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day for 3 months additionally. Initially and at the end of the observation, there were conducted: 24-hour BP monitoring with the traditional analysis of the results and determination of the hemodynamic phenotype with the QARBPP method; determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and nitrate/nitrite content; endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDVD) and pulse wave velocity (PWV) with the rheographic method. Results and discussion. Most patients had a harmonic phenotype (H) – 60.9%, but pathological classes prevailed (67.4%). During treatment, the proportion of individuals with normotensive harmonic class H2 increased significantly from 32.6% to 48.9%, independently on the vitamin D status; the average indices of BP and “pressure loads”, especially in women with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency (p<0.05) decreased; the number of patients with a normal decrease of BP at night (dipper) increased from 45.6% to 72.8%. Significant differences (p<0.05) were found in some hemodynamic parameters between patients with diastolic dysfunctional phenotype (DD) and H ones: in DD, there was higher variability of systolic BP, especially in the subgroup 2; the values of the nocturnal BP index and the frequency of its disorders (overdipper) were 25.7% and 8.9%, respectively. Vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency is associated with higher vascular stiffness, especially in DD phenotype. Individuals with the DD phenotype had the best positive dynamics of PWV in the therapy with cholecalciferol. After treatment, the level of plasma nitrates/nitrites increased, and the indicators of EDVD improved. Combined therapy with correction of vitamin D status leads to a significant decrease of PRA, most pronounced in patients with the DD phenotype. Conclusion. Correction of vitamin D status in perimenopausal women with hypertension in the antihypertensive therapy leads to a significant improvement of BP, vascular functional status, and decrease of PRA, especially in the DD phenotype.

The aim of this study was to compare prescribed dosages and hemodynamic responses of such drugs in relation to pharmacogenetic variability in CYP2D6 metabolism among patients aged ≥ 70 years exposed to polypharmacy. Materials and Methods: We included 173 patients with detailed information about drug use. The patients were retrospectively subjected to CYP2D6 genotyping, which comprised the most common variant alleles encoding reduced, absent, or increased CYP2D6 metabolism. In order to compare dosages across different CYP2D6-metabolized drugs, all prescribed daily doses were harmonized to the ‘percent of a daily defined dose’ (DDD). The mean harmonized DDD was compared between genotype-predicted normal metabolizers (NMs) and patients with reduced or absent CYP2D6 enzyme activity, defined as intermediate or poor metabolizers (IMs/PMs). Blood pressure, pulse, and patient proportions with orthostatism and bradycardia were also compared between genotype subgroups. Results: The genotype-predicted phenotype subgroups comprised 79 NMs (45.7%), 75 IMs (43.4%), and 16 PMs (9.2%). There were no differences in dosing of CYP2D6 substrates between NMs and IMs/PMs (p = 0.76). A higher proportion of CYP2D6 IMs/PMs experienced orthostatism (p = 0.03), while there were no significant subgroup differences for the other hemodynamic variables. Conclusion: In this real-life clinical setting of patients aged ≥ 70 years, dosing of CYP2D6 substrates were not adjusted according to genotype-predicted CYP2D6 metabolism. The increased occurrence of orthostatism in patients with reduced/absent CYP2D6 metabolism may indicate that individualized dosing based on genotype has the potential to prevent adverse effects in these vulnerable patients. © 2020, The Author(s).","","Aged; Alleles; Blood Pressure; Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Genotype; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polypharmacy; Retrospective Studies; amiodarone; amitriptyline; aripiprazole; carvedilol; codeine; cytochrome P450 2D6; donepezil; doxepin; fesoterodine; metoprolol; mianserin; mirtazapine; oxycodone; paroxetine; propranolol; risperidone; tamsulosin; tolterodine; tramadol; venlafaxine; cytochrome P450 2D6; aged; allele; Article; blood pressure measurement; bradycardia; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; drug exposure; drug response; enzyme activity; enzyme metabolism; female; genetic variability; genotype; genotype phenotype correlation; geriatric patient; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; major clinical study; male; orthostatic hypotension; pharmacogenetics; polypharmacy; priority journal; pulse rate; retrospective study; standing; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure; dose response; drug effect; genetics; hemodynamics; metabolism; middle aged","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083963091"

Methods: This study included 30 children with newly diagnosed essential hypertension and 30 healthy controls. The essential hypertension cohort was divided into dippers and non-dippers. Physical examinations, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, 24-h Holter monitoring, 24-h heart rate variability, conventional 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, and tissue Doppler imaging were performed. Pulse wave analysis using an oscillometric monitor was conducted to measure augmentation index (AIx) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Results: In patients with essential hypertension, left ventricular (LV) wall thickness and LV mass index were increased. There were no significant differences in LV mass index and LV wall thickness based on the dipping patterns. Time domain values and the standard deviation of all RR intervals (SDNN) were substantially lower in the essential hypertension group. SDNN values were considerably lower in the non-dipper group compared with the dipper group. In terms of frequency domain measures, low frequency measured in daytime values was much lower in the essential hypertension group compared with the control. The dipper patterns revealed that low frequency measured in nighttime values was also substantially lower in the non-dipper group. Pulse wave analysis and AIx values were notably higher in the essential hypertension patient group and those with non-dipper status. Conclusion: SDNN values, which reflect parasympathetic activity, were markedly lower in children with hypertension and the non-dipper group than healthy controls and the dipper group, respectively. Also, parameters related to arterial stiffness, such as PWV and AIx values were significantly higher in children with hypertension and the non-dipper group. © 2020 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia","Arterial stiffness; Children; Heart rate variability; Hypertension; Non-dipper status","Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Child; Circadian Rhythm; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vascular Stiffness; adolescent; adult; anthropometric parameters; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular parameters; case control study; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; Doppler echocardiography; elasticity; essential hypertension; female; heart left ventricle mass; heart left ventricle wall; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; Holter monitoring; human; left ventricular diastolic dysfunction; male; physical examination; pulse wave; retrospective study; RR interval; tissue Doppler imaging; blood pressure; circadian rhythm; heart rate; hypertension","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088493568"

Methods: Twenty participants (13 men) were randomly assigned to a thrice-weekly HIIT (n = 12) or MICE (n = 8) for 12 weeks. Hemodynamic (resting heart rate and blood pressure, carotid femoral pulse wave velocity, endothelial reactivity, and heart rate variability) and functional variables (5-time sit-to-stand, timed up and go, and 6-min walking tests) assessed before and after training. Results: Demographic, hemodynamic and functional variables were similar between groups at baseline. Endothelial reactivity tended to increase after HIIT, but not after MICE, resulting in improved level (∼8%, P < .01) of this variable in HIIT versus MICE during follow-up. Six-minute walking test improved after HIIT (10.4 ± 3.8%, P < .05), but did not change after MICE. Sit to stand improved similarly after HIIT (27.2 ± 6.1%, P < .05) and MICE (21.5 ± 5.4%, P < .05). No significant changes were found after HIIT or MICE in any other variable assessed. Conclusion: These results suggest that exercise intensity may influence traininginduced adaptation on endothelial reactivity and aerobic capacity in individuals with Parkinson's disease. © 2020 Human Kinetics, Inc.","Aging; Cardiovascular health; Endurance training; Physical function","Aged; Female; Hemodynamics; High-Intensity Interval Training; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Parkinson Disease; aged; female; hemodynamics; high intensity interval training; human; longitudinal study; male; Parkinson disease; procedures","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077637023"

We aimed to investigate changes in the pleth variability index (PVI), vena cava collapsibility index (VCCI), end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2), pulse pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) in spontaneously breathing volunteers after acute loss of 450 mL blood and passive leg raise (PLR). Methods This prospective observational study enrolled healthy volunteers in the blood donation center of an academic hospital. We measured the PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP before blood donation; at the 0th and 10th minute of blood donation; and after PLR. The primary outcome was the changes in PVI, EtCO2, VCCI, MAP, and PP. Results We enrolled thirty volunteers. There were significant differences among the four obtained measurements of the PVI, EtCO2, and MAP (P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, respectively). Compared to the predonation values, post-hoc analysis revealed an increase in the PVI at the 0th min postdonation (mean difference [MD], 5.4±5.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.6 to -3.1; P<0.001); a decrease in the EtCO2 and MAP at the 0th and 10th minute postdonation, respectively (MD, 2.4±4.6; 95% CI, 0.019 to 4.84; P=0.008 and MD, 6.4±6.4; 95% CI, 3 to 9.7; P<0.001, respectively). Compared with EtCO2 at the 10th minute, the value increased after PLR (MD, 1.8±3.2; 95% CI, 0.074 to 4.44; P=0.006). Conclusion The PVI and EtCO2 could detect early hemodynamic changes after acute blood loss. However, it remains unclear whether they can determine volume status in spontaneously breathing patients. © 2021 The Korean Society of Emergency Medicine.","Capnography; Hypovolemia; Photoplethysmography; Shock","glucose; adult; analytical parameters; arterial pressure; Article; bleeding; blood donor; breathing; breathing rate; capnometry; cava vein; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency physician; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; heart output; heart rate; human; human experiment; hypovolemia; leg; major clinical study; male; normal human; observational study; outcome assessment; oxygen saturation; photoelectric plethysmography; pleth variability index; post hoc analysis; prospective study; pulse pressure; systolic blood pressure; university hospital; vena  cava  collapsibility  index","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105127493"

Evidence also indicates that continuous exposure to organophosphorus compounds impairs cardiovascular function. However, the effect of intermittent exposure to CPF, as may be experienced in the real world, on tonic and reflex cardiorespiratory function remains unexplored. Wistar rats were injected with saline or CPF for 4 weeks (3 times/week) or 12 weeks (once/week) at the doses of 7 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. After exposure, blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (fR), tidal volume (VT), and minute volume (VE) were recorded. Systolic BP and pulse interval (PI) variability, HR spectrum, spontaneous baroreflex and chemoreflex function were also evaluated. Plasma butyrylcholinesterase and brainstem acetylcholinesterase activities were quantified. Enzymatic activity of the CPF animals was reduced after both treatment periods. Baseline BP, HR, and fR, as well as systolic BP and PI variability indices, did not change, after CPF treatment. VT and VE were elevated in CPF animals. CPF exposure increased the very low-frequency component of the HR spectrum. Baroreflex gain was reduced after CPF 4-week exposure. Chemoreflex bradycardia was reduced in the CPF-treated rats. These data show that intermittent exposure to CPF impairs cardiorespiratory function in rats. These results may have important clinical implications for workers seasonally exposed to these compounds. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Acetylcholinesterase; Baroreflex; Butyrylcholinesterase; Cardiovascular variability; Chemoreflex; Chlorpyrifos","Acetylcholinesterase; Animals; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Brain Stem; Butyrylcholinesterase; Cardiotoxicity; Chemoreceptor Cells; Chlorpyrifos; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; GPI-Linked Proteins; Heart; Heart Rate; Insecticides; Lung; Male; Rats, Wistar; Respiratory Rate; Tidal Volume; Time Factors; acetylcholinesterase; chlorpyrifos; cholinesterase; acetylcholinesterase; Ache protein, rat; chlorpyrifos; cholinesterase; cholinesterase inhibitor; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; insecticide; adult; animal experiment; Article; blood sampling; bradycardia; brain stem; breathing rate; cardiovascular function; chemoreceptor reflex; controlled study; enzyme activity; exposure; frequency modulation; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; homeostasis; intermittent exposure; male; nervous system function; neuroreflex control; nonhuman; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; pulse interval variability; rat; respiratory function; systolic blood pressure; tidal volume; Wistar rat; animal; blood; blood pressure; cardiotoxicity; chemoreceptor cell; comparative study; drug effect; enzymology; heart; innervation; lung; metabolism; pathophysiology; time factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066017119"

Fifteen healthy male (N=9) and female (N=6) adults (27.0 ± 1.14 years) completed two trials with the mask (MASK) and without the mask (CON). The 40-minute cycling exercise protocol included 10-minute phases of (1) rest, (2) 50% of VO2peak cycling, (3) 70% of VO2peak cycling, and (4) recovery. Blood pressure and pulse oximetry saturation (SPO2) were measured at each phase. An Actiwave-Cardio ECG monitor (CamNtech, UK) was used to measure HRV variables including time and frequency domains. A greater response in systolic blood pressure (p=.035) was observed at rest while SPO2 (p=.033) was lower during high-intensity cycling (70% of VO2peak) in the MASK trial. The HRV indices were not different between trials during cycling. However, heart rate (p=.047) was greater while inter-beat interval and sympathovagal balance (the ratio between low-frequency and high-frequency components; ln LF/HF, p=.01) were lower in the MASK than the CON trials during recovery. Wearing an ETM during high-intensity cycling (70% of VO2peak) induces modest hypoxaemia. Although this device did not affect HRV changes during cycling, it seems to delay the cardiac-autonomic recovery from exercise. Healthy adults may be required to perform high-intensity exercise with an ETM to simulate a hypoxic environment, but future studies are needed to determine whether repeated exposure to this condition provides similar benefits as altitude training. © 2019 Institute of Sport.

Within the broad range of conventional and unconventional intervention methods used in cognitive enhancement, meditation is one of those that is safe, widely practiced by many since ancient times, and has been shown to reduce stress and improve psychological health and cognitive functioning. Various neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) have shown functional and structural changes due to meditation in different types of meditation practices and on various groups of meditators. Recently, a few studies on meditation have used functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to study the effects of meditation on cerebral hemodynamics. In this study, we examined the short-term effects of loving-kindness (LK) meditation on sustained attention using behavioral performance measures, physiological outcomes, and cognitive activity as measured by fNIRS in first-time meditators during Stroop color word task (SCWT) performance. Our results indicated that behavioral outcomes, assessed mainly on response time (RT) during SCWT performance, showed a significant decrease after meditation. As expected, physiological measures, primarily pulse pressure (PP) measured after meditation dropped significantly as compared to the before meditation measurement. For the hemodynamic measures of oxygenated-hemoglobin (HbO2), deoxygenated-hemoglobin (Hb), and total-hemoglobin (HbT), our findings show significant differences in SCWT performance before and after meditation. Our results suggest that LK meditation can result in improvements in cognitive, physiological, and behavioral outcomes of first-time meditators after a short-term session. © 2020 by the authors.

We reviewed the literature to evaluate current evidence of the effect of nociception-guided management over standard anesthesia practice during surgery. A systematic review of the literature on the effect of nociception monitoring on anesthesia practice was conducted. Reports were eligible if they compared nociception-guided anesthesia to standard practice during surgery. Primary endpoint of this review is intraoperative opioid consumption. Secondary endpoints included hemodynamic control, postoperative pain and pain treatment. We identified 12 randomized controlled trials that compared one of five different nociception monitoring techniques to standard anesthesia care. Most studies were single center studies of small sample size. Six studies reported intraoperative opioid consumption as primary outcome. There was considerable variability with respect to surgical procedure and anesthesia technique. For nociception monitors that were investigated by more than one study, analysis of the pooled data was performed. The surgical plethysmographic index was the only monitor for which an intra operative opioid sparing effect was found. For the other monitors, either no effect was detected, or pooled analysis could not be performed due to paucity of study data. On secondary outcomes, no consistent effect of nociception-guided anesthesia could be established. Although some nociception monitors show promising results, no definitive conclusions regarding the effect of nociception monitoring on intraoperative opioid consumption or other anesthesia related outcome can be drawn.

Materials and Methods Seventy-four participants (50 healthy participants and 24 participants with long-standing hypertension) were prospectively included between January 2018 and October 2018, and underwent ultrasound time-harmonic elastography of the upper abdominal aorta. Compound maps of shear-wave speed (SWS) as a surrogate of tissue stiffness were generated from multifrequency wave fields covering the full field-of-view of B-mode ultrasound. Blood pressure and pulse wave velocity were measured beforehand. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement was determined in 30 subjects. Reproducibility of time-harmonic elastography was assessed in subgroups with repeated measurements after 20 minutes and after 6 months. Linear regression analysis, with subsequent age adjustment of SWS obtained, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical evaluation. Results Linear regression analysis revealed a significant effect of age on SWS with an increase by 0.024 m/s per year (P < 0.001). Age-adjusted SWS was significantly greater in hypertensives (0.24 m/s; interquartile range [IQR], 0.17-0.40 m/s) than in healthy participants (0.07 m/s; IQR,-0.01 to 0.06 m/s; P < 0.001). A cutoff value of 0.15 m/s was found to differentiate best between groups (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.966; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.0; P < 0.001; 83% sensitivity and 98% specificity). Interobserver and intraobserver variability was excellent (ICC, 0.987 and 0.937, respectively). Reproducibility was excellent in the short term (ICC, 0.968; confidence interval, 0.878-0.992) and good in the long term (ICC, 0.844; confidence interval, 0.491-0.959).

We aimed to investigate acute autonomic effects of RO on hemodynamic parameters of Wistar and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Methods: Rats were anesthetized and femoral artery and veins were cannulated. Next day, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Acute effects of RO (1.25, 2.5, or 5.0 mg/kg; iv) on BP, HR, and variability of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and pulse interval (PI) were assessed. The effects of RO were also investigated in SHR, which received atropine (2 mg/kg), propranolol (4 mg/kg), or hexamethonium (20 mg/kg) 15 min before receiving RO. Vasorelaxant effects of RO (10–10 to 10–4 M) on aortic rings of rats were also assessed. Key findings: In Wistar rats, none of the RO doses evoked significant changes in BP, HR, and variability of SAP and PI. On the other hand, in SHR, RO elicited reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP), and prevented the increase in the low frequency power (LF) of the SAP spectra. Pretreatment with atropine or propranolol did not alter hypotension, but attenuated RO-induced bradycardia. Hexamethonium prevented RO-induced hypotension and bradycardia. RO exerted vasorelaxant effects on aortic rings with (Wistar and SHR) or without functional endothelium (SHR only). Significance: Rose oxide, a monoterpene with anti-inflammatory properties, acts as an antihypertensive molecule due to its ability to acutely promote hypotension and bradycardia in spontaneously hypertensive rats. © 2021","Arterial hypertension; Autonomic nervous system; Autonomic receptors; Monoterpenes; Rose oxide","Acyclic Monoterpenes; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antihypertensive Agents; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Heart Rate; Hypertension; Male; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Wistar; Species Specificity; Vasodilation; atropine; hexamethonium; monoterpene; propranolol; rose oxide; sodium chloride; unclassified drug; antihypertensive agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; rose-oxide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antihypertensive activity; antiinflammatory activity; aortic endothelium; aortic ring (slice); Article; autonomic innervation; blood pressure variability; bradycardia; chemoprophylaxis; controlled study; drug effect; femoral artery; femoral vein; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; hypertension; hypotension; in vivo study; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; pulse interval; rat; systolic blood pressure; vasodilatation; animal; blood pressure; dose response; hypertension; pathophysiology; pharmacology; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; species difference; spontaneously hypertensive rat; Wistar rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118325529"

While this haemodynamic variable is recognised as clinically important, there is a paucity of reports of its range and responsiveness to volume expansion in patients without cardiovascular disease and no reports of correlations to echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular filling. Methods: Twenty-seven awake (13 male), spontaneously breathing patients without any history of cardiopulmonary, vascular or renal disease were studied prior to induction of anaesthesia. The no-flow equilibrium pressure in the arm following rapid circulatory occlusion (P                             arm                             ) was measured via a radial arterial catheter. Transthoracic echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular end diastolic area and volume as well as the diameter of the inferior vena cava. The P                             arm                              and echocardiographic variables were measured before and after administration of 500 mL 0.9% NaCl over 10 minutes.

The first one was the main group (n=94; age – 54.4±0.9 years), М±m), the second one – the comparison group (n=104; age – 53.7±0.9 years). The indices of 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in the main group and the comparison group were the following: the mean daytime systolic blood pressure was 109.6±1.6 and 121.1±1.1 mm Hg, the minimal one was 74.4±2.0 mm Hg and 82.3±12.5 mm Hg, and the maximal one was 168.2±1.9 and 161.9±1.7 mm Hg, p<0.05. The daytime systolic blood pressure sigma (17.9±0.6) and the average real variability of systolic blood pressure (11.31±2.52 mm Hg) were bigger in the main group (p<0.01). The daytime index of hyperbaric load of systolic blood pressure was bigger in the main group: it was 403.6±25.9 against 231.7±12.1 mm Hg × h in the comparison group (p<0.01). The maximal pulse pressure for a 24-hours interval was 74.2±2.0 and 66.4±0.9 mm Hg, respectively (p<0.01). The indices of ultrasonography of the large cervical arteries in the right and left vessels of the main group were the following: the Gosling's pulsatility index was 1.578±0.059 and 1.552±0.042 for the common carotid artery, 1.210±0.044 and 1.102±0.037 for the internal carotid artery, 1.191±0.030 and 1.150±0.023 for the vertebral artery. The above-mentioned indices were bigger in the main group than in the comparison one (p<0.01). The diameters of all the large cervical arteries were bigger in the main group (p<0.01).

Following this, at 120 days-of age, sedentary and trained rats received a hypercaloric diet (HFD) or a commercial diet normal fat diet (NFD) for 30 days. Body weight (BW) and food intake were evaluated weekly. At 150 days-of age, hemodynamic measures (systolic, diastolic, mean blood pressure, pulse pressure, pulse interval and heart rate) were made via an indwelling femoral artery catheter. Beat-to-beat data were analyzed to calculate power spectra of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse interval. After euthanasia, mesenteric fat pads were removed and weighted and total blood was stored for later analysis of lipid profile. Consumption of a HFD increased blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure, low frequency BP variability, BW gain, fat pad stores and induced dyslipidemia. Interestingly, prior physical training was able to partially protect against this rise in BP and body fat stores. Prior physical training did not totally protect against the effects of HFD consumption but previously trained animals did demonstrate resistance to the development of cardiometabolic alterations, which illustrate that the benefits of physical training may be partially maintained even after 30 days of detraining period. © 2019 Tófolo, Rinaldi, Gôngora, Matiusso, Pavanello, Malta, de Almeida, Ribeiro, Oliveira, Peres, Armitage, Mathias and Palma-Rigo.

We hypothesized that acute and short-term tDCS intervention can promote similar benefits in resistant hypertensive patients (RHT). We assessed the impact of one (acute intervention) and ten (short-term intervention) tDCS or SHAM (20 min, each) sessions on BP, pulse interval (PI) and systolic blood pressure variabilities, humoral mechanisms associated with BP regulation, and cytokines levels. True RHT subjects (n = 13) were randomly submitted to one and ten SHAM and tDCS crossing sessions (1 week of “washout”). Hemodynamic (Finometer®, Beatscope), office BP, and autonomic variables (accessed through spectral analysis of the pulse-to-pulse BP signal, in the time and frequency domain – Fast Fourrier Transform) were measured at baseline and after the short-term intervention. 24 h-ambulatory BP monitoring was measured after acute and short-term protocols. Acute intervention: tDCS reduced BP, cardiac output, and increase high-frequency band of PI (vagal modulation to the heart). Short-term protocol: tDCS did not change BP and cardiac output parameters. In contrast, central systolic BP (−12%), augmentation index (−31%), and pulse wave velocity (34%) were decreased by the short-term tDCS when compared to SHAM. These positive results were accompanied by a reduction in the low-frequency band (−37%) and an increase of the high-frequency band of PI (+62%) compared to SHAM. These findings collectively indicate that short-term tDCS concomitantly improves resting cardiac autonomic control and pulse wave behavior and reduces central BP in RHT patients, https://ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-8n7c9p. © 2022, Frontiers Media S.A.

We aim to evaluate their accuracy and reliability to predict fluid responsiveness after induction in children aged 4-9 years undergoing major neurosurgery. Methods: Children aged 4-9 years undergoing intracranial epileptic foci excision were enrolled. After the induction of anesthesia, fluid loading with 10 mL/kg of Ringer's solution over 10 min was administered before surgical incision. PVI, PPV, SVV, and Eadyn were measured before and within 5 min after fluid loading. Respiratory variation in aortic blood flow peak velocity (ΔVpeak) >15% at baseline, measured using transthoracic echocardiography, identified fluid ""responders"". The abilities of dynamic variables to predict an increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >10% following fluid loading were also assessed. Results: Fourteen (31.8%) of forty-four patients were responders defined by a baseline ΔVpeak >15%. Before fluid loading, only the PVI value was significantly different between R and NR (P=0.017). Baseline PVI showed fair diagnostic accuracy for fluid responsiveness, with an area under the curve (AUROC) of 0.735 and the cutoff value of 13%. The R group showed a significantly greater absolute change in PPV and SVV after fluid loading from baseline compared with the NR group (P=0.021 and 0.040, respectively). The absolute change in the PPV and SVV values from baseline was greater in R than those in NR (P=0.021 and 0.040, respectively). Twenty (45.5%) showed a MAP increase of >10% following fluid loading and were defined as responders. Baseline ΔVpeak and SVV showed fair predictive values for a MAP increase of >10% (AUROC =0.758 and 0.715, respectively). Conclusions: PVI at baseline showed fair reliability to predict fluid responsiveness after anesthesia induction in mechanically ventilated children aged 4-9 years undergoing neurosurgery.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but its association with height remains largely underrecognized. Objectives: The objective of this manuscript is to review the evidence examining the association between blood pressure and human stature and to summarize the plausible pathophysiological mechanisms behind such an association. Methods: A systematic review of adult human height and its association with hypertension and coronary artery disease was undertaken. The literature evidence is summarized and tabulated, and an overview of the pathophysiological basis for this association is presented. Results: Shorter arterial lengths found in shorter individuals may predispose to hypertension in a complex hemodynamic interplay, which is explained predominantly by summated arterial wave reflections and an elevated augmentation index. Our systemic review suggests that an inverse relationship between adult height and blood pressure exists. However, differences in the studied populations and heterogeneity in the methods applied across the various studies limit the generalizability of these findings and their clinical application. Conclusion: Physiological studies and epidemiological data suggest a potential inverse association between adult height and blood pressure. Further research is required to define the relationship more clearly between adult height and blood pressure and to assess whether antihypertensive therapeutic approaches and goals should be modified according to patients' heights.  © 2021 S.

Results: One single aerobic exercise session was not effective to provoke post-exercise hypotension and vascular improvements.

Although these conditions have been viewed as distinct entities, there is increasing evidence that neurodegenerative and vascular pathologies interact or overlap to cause cognitive decline, and that at least in some cases individuals at risk of cognitive decline exhibit abnormal cardiovascular physiology long before emergence of disease. However, the mechanisms linking haemodynamic disturbances with cognitive impairment and the various pathologies that cause dementia are poorly understood. A sub-sample of 502 participants from the Medical Research Council National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) have participated in the first visit of a neuroscience sub-study referred to as Insight 46, where clinical, cognitive, imaging, and lifestyle data have been collected for the purpose of elucidating the pathological changes preceding dementia. This paper outlines the cardiovascular phenotyping performed in the follow-up visit of Insight 46, with the study participants now aged 74. In addition to standard cardiovascular assessments such as blood pressure measurements, echocardiography, and electrocardiography (ECG), functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been included to provide an assessment of cerebrovascular function. A detailed description of the fNIRS protocol along with preliminary results from pilot data is presented. The combination of lifestyle data, brain structure/ function, cognitive performance, and cardiovascular health obtained not only from Insight 46, but also from the whole NSHD provides an exciting opportunity to advance our understanding of the cardiovascular mechanisms underlying dementia and cognitive decline, and identify novel targets for intervention. © 2020 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.

As a consequence, the hemodynamics around a cerebral aneurysm change, and therefore, also the corresponding in- and outlet boundary conditions (BCs) used for three-dimensional (3D) calculations of hemodynamic indices. In this study, we investigate the effects of variations in systemic properties on wall shear stress (WSS) indices of a cerebral aneurysm. We created a virtual patient database by varying systemic properties within physiological ranges. BCs for 3D-CFD simulations were derived using a pulse wave propagation model for each realization of the virtual database. WSS indices were derived from the 3D simulations and their variabilities quantified. Variations in BCs, caused by changes in systemic properties, yielded variabilities in the WSS indices that were of the same order of magnitude as differences in these WSS indices between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. Sensitivity analysis showed that the systemic properties impacted both in- and outlet BCs simultaneously and altered the WSS indices. We conclude that the influence of variations in patient-specific systemic properties on WSS indices should be evaluated when using WSS indices in multidisciplinary rupture prediction models. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive generalised polynomial chaos expansion; cerebral aneurysms; pulse wave propagation model; sensitivity analysis","Hemodynamics; Humans; Hydrodynamics; Intracranial Aneurysm; Models, Cardiovascular; Stress, Mechanical; Acoustic wave velocity; Computational fluid dynamics; Sensitivity analysis; Shear stress; Wave propagation; Cerebral Aneurysms; Intracranial aneurysms; One-dimensional model; Outlet boundary condition; Polynomial chaos expansion; Pulse wave propagation; Rupture predictions; Threedimensional (3-d); artery compliance; Article; brain artery aneurysm; brain artery aneurysm rupture; brain blood flow; brain blood vessel; data base; heart output; hemodynamics; human; prediction; pulse wave; sensitivity analysis; shear stress; vascular resistance; Young modulus; biological model; diagnostic imaging; hydrodynamics; intracranial aneurysm; mechanical stress; Shear flow","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082342093"

Simple methods with minimal side-effects like application of 2% lignocaine jelly is observed to reduce such complications in the normal population. The rationale of this study is to directly compare such effects between smokers and non-smokers.It is an observational study including 60 participants aged between 20 to 60 years with ASA 1 and 2 physical status undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia. The patients were randomized in to two groups - smokers and non-smokers. Lignocaine 2% jelly was applied to endo-tracheal tube cuffs in both groups. Comparison was made between the two groups with regards to post operative cough and sore throat at intervals of 1 hour and 24 hours post extubation as well as hemodynamic variability at pre-induction, 3 mins, 15 mins post intubation and 3 mins post extubation. Students t-test, Fishers exact test and Mann-Whitney test was used for comparison between the two groups.1-hour sore throat was significantly lower in non-smoker group (p=0.000). However, incidence of 24-hour sore throat was comparable (p=0.104). The number and severity of cough was greater in smoker group, even after the application of 2% lignocaine jelly (p=0.003). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic variables pre and postoperatively.Noticeable difference was observed between smokers and non-smokers with regard to respiratory complications post-extubation. We must consider smoking as a public health hazard and effects of chronic smoking cannot be discounted when taking in to account benefits observed with lignocaine jelly on ET tube cuffs. © 2020 Oriental Scientific Publishing Company.

In Asian countries, the prevalence of OSA is high, as in Western countries. When blood pressure (BP) is evaluated in OSA individuals using ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), the BP phenotype often indicates abnormal BP variability, such as increased nighttime BP or abnormal diurnal BP variation, that is, non-dipper pattern, riser pattern, and morning BP surge, and all these conditions have been associated with increased CVD events. Asians have a higher prevalence of increased nighttime BP or morning BP surge than Westerners. Therefore, this review paper focused on OSA and hypertension from an Asian perspective to investigate the importance of the association between OSA and hypertension in the Asian population. Such abnormal BP variability has been shown to be associated with progression of arterial stiffness, and this association could provoke a vicious cycle between abnormal BP phenotypes and arterial stiffness, a phenomenon recognized as systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome (SHATS). OSA may be one of the background factors that augment SHATS. An oxygen-triggered nocturnal oscillometric BP measurement device combined with a pulse oximeter for continuous SpO2 monitoring could detect BP variability caused by OSA. In addition to treating the OSA, accurate and reliable detection and treatment of any residual BP elevation and BP variability caused by OSA would be necessary to prevent CVD events. However, more detailed detection of BP variability, such as beat-by-beat BP monitoring, would further help to reduce CV events. © 2021 The Authors.

We investigated the heritability of these phenotypes, their association with BP-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and the causal association between BP and arterial stiffness. Methods and results: We assessed BP, central BP components, and haemodynamic properties (during a single visit) including CO, SVR, and pulse wave velocity (PWV, measure of arterial stiffness) in 3531 (1934 monozygotic, 1586 dizygotic) female TwinsUK participants. Heritability was estimated using structural equation modelling. Association with 984 BP-associated SNP was examined using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and generalized estimating equation regression. One and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to estimate the causal direction between BP and arterial stiffness including data on 436 419 UK Biobank participants. We found high heritability for systolic and pulsatile components of BP (>50%) and PWV (65%) with overlapping genes accounting for >50% of their observed correlation. Environmental factors explained most of the variability of CO and SVR (>80%). Regression identified SNPs (n = 5) known to be associated with BP to also be associated with PWV. One-sample MR showed evidence of bi-directional causal association between BP and PWV in TwinsUK participants. Two-sample MR, confirmed a bi-directional causal effect of PWV on BP (inverse variance weighted (IVW) beta =.11, P <.02) and BP on arterial stiffness (IVW beta =.004, P <.0001). Conclusion: The genetic basis of BP is mediated not only by genes regulating BP but also by genes that influence arterial stiffness. Mendelian randomization indicates a bi-directional causal association between BP and arterial stiffness.  © 2020 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

Aim. To study position-dependent changes in oxygen saturation based on the study of the pathogenetic effect of venous blood flow in the ""pool"" of the left renal vein on the general hemodynamics and hormones of the adrenal cortex. Material and methods. A method for the polypositional assessment of oxygen saturation disturbances in six static states has been developed: standing, sitting, on the back, on the abdomen, on your right side, on your left side. Statistical data processing was carried out, which made it possible to determine the relationship between the indicators. Results. Polypositional studies of oxygen saturation hemodynamic parameters (SpO2) in six static states revealed the variability of the relationships of these groups when comparing them. The correlation was high, statistically significant between diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) pressure, moderate between pulse (Ps)and SBP, pulse and DBP, weak between pulse and saturation. The groups divided by body positions relative to the pulse, SBP and DBP did not have a cluster structure. In the pron-position, SO2 had a minimal value, significantly different from the data in the other positions. Conclusion. Body position is one of the pathogenetically significant factors regulating blood oxygen saturation, which can help in the treatment and rehabilitation of patients with respiratory failure (COVID-19). Polypositional saturation measurement in six static states can determine a new, more effective algorithm for the management of patients with respiratory failure, both during treatment and during rehabilitation. © 2021, The authors This is an open article under the CC BY license.","Aortomesenteric ""tweezers""; Blood flow; Dehydroepiandrosterone; Pressure; Pron-position; Pulse; Saturation; Testosterone","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120821206"

Design and methods. We examined 96 students of the northern medical university (61 females). During academic days, we performed ambulatory monitoring of blood pressure (ABPM) 24 h + 10-120 minutes. We analyzed following parameters: mezors of heart rate (HR), systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and pulse blood pressure (BP), mean BP, Kerdo autonomic index (KI), functional change index (FCI); hypertension time indices of SBP (TI SBP) and DBD (TI DBP) (%), variability of SBP (Var. SBD) and DBD (Var. DBP); night dipping of SBP and DBP (%). We assessed coping behavior. The sleep was assessed using the subjective characteristics of sleep questionnaire and the Epworth sleepiness scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistica 10.0 and Excel 2013 software. Results. We found optimal/normal values of mean BP and intersexual differences among students. Female students in all periods showed higher rates of HR and sympathetic influences; males had higher SBD, higher TI SBP during day and night, higher SBP variability at night, and tended to develop isolated systolic hypertension. Parameters and dynamics of the vascular component of BP are in normal ranges. We did not find significant intersexual differences in mechanisms of the vascular regulation. Cardiovascular system regulation in males depended on the sleep and coping, and it was more autonomous from behavior in girls. Conclusions. One of the most effective and affordable ways to prevent cardiovascular diseases during the university education is the consistent training of students in adaptive behavior in a situation of psycho-emotional stress and recommendations on sleep hygiene. Greater efficiency of the learning adaptive coping behavior can be expected in males, and male gender is one of the non-modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular pathology. © 2019 All-Russian Public Organization Antihypertensive League.

Net effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on blood pressure may result from interplay between vasodilatation, increased natriuresis, heart rate and sympathetic nervous system activity. The aim of study was to compare hemodynamic effect of single subcutaneous dose of 1.2 mg liraglutide to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and impaired renal function. This cross-over study included 17 patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 17 patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored for 24 hours after liraglutide or placebo. Before and after each medication, systemic vascular resistance, heart rate variability, pulse wave velocity and central blood pressure were measured. Significant increases of 24 h mean heart rate and cardiac output were seen in both groups. Sympathetic predominance was observed in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 after GLP-1R agonist compared to placebo (p = 0.005). Systemic vascular resistance decreased after liraglutide compared with placebo only in patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.002), whereas pulse wave velocity increased after liraglutide compared with placebo only in patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p = 0.0006). The 24 h mean arterial pressure after liraglutide significantly increased compared to placebo only in latter group. Liraglutide administration in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces increase of blood pressure due to increase of cardiac output secondary to acceleration of heart rate associated with sympathetic predominance. The vasodilatory effect of liraglutide is preserved only in earlier CKD. © 2021, Polish Physiological Society.

In long-term stationary data recordings, such synchronization can be estimated by the coherence. The phase synchronization index (PSI) can be used as well. The aim of this study was to correlate PSI and the coherence of AP and PI under stationary conditions and to estimate the informativity of PSI as a measure of baroreflex activity during transient processes. Approach: AP and PI were recorded in conscious Wistar rats using femoral artery catheters. To study the hemodynamics during hemorrhage, blood was gradually withdrawn (20 ml kg-1 over 30 min) through a catheter in the carotid artery. Main results: PSI and coherence spectra calculated from 30-minute AP and PI recordings demonstrated distinct peaks at the frequency of 0.4 Hz; these indicators correlate well with each other (Pearson r = 0.920, p < 0.0001). Both PSI and coherence were markedly suppressed by vagal blockade (methylatropine) and tended to reduce after sympathetic blockade (atenolol). Importantly, PSI demonstrated dynamic alterations during gradual hemorrhage. During the initial approx. 10 min of hemorrhage, AP did not change but PI was noticeably shortened, and PSI increased, which indicates the activation of the baroreflex. With further blood loss, baroreflex influences were not enough to prevent blood pressure from falling, and under such conditions PSI decreased. Significance: PSI, like coherence, is an informative measure of baroreflex activity under stationary conditions. In addition, PSI permits us to follow the coupling between the baroreflex oscillations of AP and PI during transient processes, which strengthens its informative value. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","atenolol; baroreflex; cross-spectral analysis; hemodynamic variability; hypovolemia; methylatropine; phase synchronization","Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Heart; Hemorrhage; Male; Pulse; Rats, Wistar; Blood; Catheters; Hemodynamics; Rats; Spectrum analysis; Synchronization; Arterial pressures; Atenolol; Baroreflex; Cross-spectral analysis; Haemodynamics; Hemodynamic variability; Hypovolemia; Methylatropine; Phase synchronization; Synchronization index; animal; autonomic nervous system; bleeding; blood pressure; heart; male; pathophysiology; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse rate; Wistar rat; Blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85067213607"

However, it should be remembered that an unnecessary volume expansion may exacerbate the hemodynamic. In mechanically ventilated patients, the ventilatory induced hemodynamic variations (VIHV) can be used to predict the fluid requirement. These variations (called dynamic indices of cardiac filling pressure), are superior to static indices (central venous and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) in diagnosing any volume requirement. We theorized that some conditions other than hypovolemia might affect these hemodynamic variations. Objectives: The current study aimed to discover these conditions in adult patients admitted to post-cardiac surgery ICU. Methods: This antegrade cross-sectional study was conducted on 304 adult patients who were admitted to ICU after elective cardiac surgery in a teaching hospital (Tabriz-Iran). During the first 3 hours of the admission, the systolic (∆SBP), diastolic (∆DBP), mean (∆MAP), and arterial blood pulse pressures (∆PP) were invasively monitored and calculated in percent value. Because of the return of spontaneous breathing in most of the patients, the calculations were done only during the first 3-hour. All patients with spontaneous breathing, irregular cardiac rhythm, or re-admission to OR in this period were excluded from the study. We recorded demographic and surgical characteristics, perioperative hemodynamic and echocardiographic, and complications data and surveyed the correlation between VIHV and perioperative data. Results: Two hundred and ninety two patients met the inclusion criteria. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was the most common surgery (64.4 %). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was used in 95.55% of the surgeries. In the first 24-hour, 51 patients required re-operation because of sternum closure, bleeding control, cardiac tamponade, and coronary artery revascularization. Mortality and morbidity occurred in 2 (0.68%) and 50 (17.12%) patients, respectively. Among VIHVs, the ∆PP had the most significant value. Thus, mean ∆PP was calculated and the correlation between its severity (≤ 20% vs. > 20%) and other values surveyed. It was high in patients with cardiac dysfunction and tamponade (P value < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between mean ∆PP severity and hemorrhage rate, fluid balance, need to vasoactive agents, blood products, or bleeding control, redo CABG or sternum closure surgery, time to tracheal extubation, ICU stay, and postoperative complications. Patients with closed sternum were the same as those with the unclosed sternum. Conclusions: The ∆PP was the most sensitive VIHV parameter. Cardiac dysfunction and tamponade increased ∆PP. Unclosed sternum did not affect its value. ∆PP value did not affect postoperative complications rate, time to tracheal extubation, or ICU stay. © 2020, Author(s).","Arterial Pulse Pressure; Cardiac Surgery; Mechanical Ventilation; Ventilatory Induced Hemodynamic Variations","hypertensive agent; vasoactive agent; vasodilator agent; adult; anuria; arterial blood pulse pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; breathing; calculation; cardiac filling pressure; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiovascular parameters; central venous occlusion pressure; clinical evaluation; controlled study; coronary artery bypass graft; coronary artery recanalization; correlation analysis; cross-sectional study; demography; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; disease severity assessment; echocardiography; female; fluid balance; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart preload; heart rhythm; heart right ventricle ejection fraction; heart surgery; heart tamponade; hemodynamic variability; hemodynamics; human; hypotension; hypovolemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mild renal impairment; mortality; oliguria; perioperative period; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; sternum closure; systolic blood pressure; tidal volume; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093884369"

To investigate the age-dependence of total retinal blood flow and total retinal oxygen extraction in healthy subjects and determine their possible correlations with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters. METHODS. This observational cross-sectional study consisted of 68 healthy subjects (mean 6 SD age, 45.6 6 16.3 years; 47% female). Total retinal oxygen extraction was calculated based on measurement of total retinal blood flow using bi-directional Doppler OCT and measurement of oxygen saturation using spectroscopic reflectometry. Retinal nerve fiber layer thickness was measured using OCT, and the total number of retinal ganglion cells was estimated based on a previous published model. Correlation of these parameters with age was studied and the association between structural OCT parameters and hemodynamic vascular parameters was calculated. RESULTS. Both structural and vascular parameters showed a significant decline with increasing age. The correlation coefficients were between r 0.25 and r 0.41. Furthermore, structural and vascular parameters were significantly correlated with each other. The strongest association was found between the level of total retinal oxygen extraction and the number of retinal ganglion cells (r 0.75, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. We showed that there was an age-related decline of retinal oxygen extraction. Levels of retinal oxygen extraction are correlated to retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and number of retinal ganglion cells. Our data partially explain the wide inter-individual variability in retinal blood flow values in healthy subjects.

ELA-2 is involved in hemodynamic and autonomic control and is upregulated in myocardial infarction and hypertension. The inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increased ELA-2 expression in the carotid arteries and heart of spontaneously hypertensive rats. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of ACE inhibition in hemodynamic and autonomic balance in elastase-2 knockout (ELA-2 KO) mice. Male ELA-2 KO and C57BL/6 mice were treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril or saline for 10 days. After treatment, mice underwent surgery for cannulation of the femoral artery and arterial pressure recordings were made five days later in awake animals. The variability of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse interval (PI) was evaluated in the time and frequency domain. Spontaneous baroreflex was assessed by the sequencing method. ACE inhibition caused a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (117±2.2 vs 100±2.8 mmHg) and an increase in heart rate (570±32 vs 655± 15 bpm) in ELA-2 KO mice. Despite a tendency towards reduction in the overall heart rate variability (standard deviation of successive values: 7.6±1.1 vs 4.7±0.6 ms, P=0.08), no changes were found in the root of the mean sum of squares or in the power of the high-frequency band. ACE inhibition did not change the spontaneous baroreflex indices (gain and baroreflex effectiveness index) in ELA-2 KO mice. Altogether, this data suggested that ACE played a role in the maintenance of hemodynamic function in ELA-2 KO mice. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

The long-term effects of PCOS are attributed to several metabolic aberrations ensuing the syndrome. In a systematic review of literature regarding the cardiovascular risk factors that accompany PCOS, we found that macrovascular function has been assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), microvascular function by venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP), and arterial structure by ultrasonographic assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) usually of the carotid artery. Contradictory results have been reported; however, in most studies, endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerosis assessed either by haemodynamic methods such as FMD or by biochemical methods such as endothelin-1 levels, was found to be impaired. VOP is a less-studied method, with few indices altered. IMT was found to be altered in most of the included studies, but the population was more heterogeneous. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, were also found to be altered in most studies. On the other hand, a number of interventions have been shown beneficial for the markers of cardiovascular risk, in the context of insulin-sensitizers. However, other interventions such as oral contraceptive pills or statins did not consistently show a similar beneficial effect. In summary, the early identification and eventual treatment of cardiovascular clinical and biochemical risk factors may be used in clinical practice to prevent potential 'silent' triggers of cardiovascular disease. © Touch Medical Media 2021","Arterial stiffness; Flow-mediated dilatation; Inositols; Insulin resistance; Insulin sensitizers; Intima-media thickness; Metformin; Nitrate-mediated dilatation; Polycystic ovary syndrome; Spironolactone","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; acetylcholine; adipocytokine; advanced glycation end product; alpha tocopherol; androstenedione; atorvastatin; biochemical marker; C reactive protein; carnitine; cell adhesion molecule; drospirenone; drospirenone plus ethinylestradiol; endothelin 1; folic acid; ghrelin; glucagon like peptide 1; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; inositol; insulin; insulin sensitizing agent; interleukin 6; leptin; liraglutide; metformin; nitroprusside sodium; noradrenalin; omega 3 fatty acid; oral contraceptive agent; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; pioglitazone; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; prasterone sulfate; rosiglitazone; selectin (glycoprotein); simvastatin; spironolactone; testosterone; tumor necrosis factor; abdominal obesity; abnormal blood pressure; androstenedione blood level; aorta; arterial stiffness; arterial wall thickness; artery calcification; Article; atheroma; atherosclerosis; autonomic innervation; biochemical analysis; brachial artery; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular risk factor; carotid artery; carotid atherosclerosis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; daytime somnolence; dyslipidemia; endothelial dysfunction; ethnicity; ex vivo study; exercise; female; flow-mediated dilation test; forearm blood flow; gynecologic surgery; heart function; heart protection; heart rate variability; hemodynamics; human; hyperandrogenism; hyperemia; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; information retrieval; insulin metabolism; insulin resistance; internal carotid artery; laparoscopic ovarian drilling; leg blood flow; low birth weight; Medline; metabolic disorder; metabolic syndrome X; microcirculation; microvasculature; myography; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; obesity; ophthalmic artery; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; plethysmography; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prevalence; protein phosphorylation; pulsatility index; pulse wave; pulse wave velocity; risk assessment; sleep disordered breathing; systematic review; testosterone blood level; thermotherapy; treatment duration; triacylglycerol level; vascular smooth muscle; vein occlusion plethysmography; Young modulus","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106219748"

We aimed to determine whether blood pressure variation over a period of years, considering both magnitude and direction, is associated with the risk of dementia. Methods and findings In a prospective cohort study ongoing since 1989 in the Netherlands, 5,273 dementia-free participants (58.1% women; mean [SD] age, 67.6 [8.0] years) were included. As of 2016, 1,059 dementia cases occurred during a median follow-up of 14.6 years. Absolute variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was assessed as the absolute difference in SBP divided by the mean over two sequential visits every 4.2 (median) years, with the first quantile set as the reference level. The direction was the rise or fall in SBP, with the third quantile set as the reference level. We estimated the risk of dementia in relation to SBP variation measured at different time windows (i.e., at least 0, 5, 10, and 15 years) prior to dementia diagnosis, with adjustments for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, vascular risk factors, and history of cardiovascular disease. We repeated the above analysis for variation in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). A large SBP variation was associated with an increased dementia risk, which became more pronounced with longer intervals between the assessment of SBP variation and the diagnosis of dementia. The hazard ratio (HR) associated with large variation (the highest quintile) increased from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-1.34, P = 0.337) for risk within 5 years of SBP variation measurement to 3.13 (95% CI 2.05-4.77; P < 0.001) for risk after at least 15 years since the measurement of SBP variation. The increased long-term risk was associated with both large rises (HR for the highest quintile, 3.31 [95% CI 2.11-5.18], P < 0.001) and large falls in SBP (HR for the lowest quintile, 2.20 [95% CI 1.33-3.63], P = 0.002), whereas the higher short-term risk was only associated with large falls in SBP (HR, 1.21 [95% CI 1.00-1.48], P = 0.017). Similar findings were observed for variation in DBP. Despite our assessment of major confounders, potential residual confounding is possible, and the findings on blood pressure variability over periods of years may not be generalizable to variability over periods of days and other shorter periods. Conclusions Results of this study showed that a large blood pressure variation over a period of years was associated with an increased long-term risk of dementia. The association between blood pressure variation and dementia appears most pronounced when this variation occurred long before the diagnosis. An elevated long-term risk of dementia was observed with both a large rise and fall in blood pressure. © 2019 Ma et al.

We investigated this hypothesis in a large, adult population-based study (ViDA trial [Vitamin D Assessment] trial). To interpret the clusters and evaluate their usefulness, we examined their predictors and associations with cardiovascular events. In 4253 adults (mean age 65 years; 55% male) without a prior cardiovascular event, suprasystolic oscillometry was performed, yielding aortic pressure waveforms and several hemodynamic parameters. Participants were followed up for 4.6 years (median), accruing 300 cardiovascular events. Principal component analysis reduced 14 arterial waveform parameters to 3 uncorrelated factors that together explained 90% of the variability of the original data. Factors 1, 2, and 3 appeared to represent BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection, respectively. Across 6 antihypertensive drug classes, there were no differences in brachial systolic (P=0.23) and diastolic (P=0.13) BP; but there were significant variations in factor 3 (P<0.0001), especially for β-blocker use. The first and third factors were positively associated with cardiovascular events (multivariable-adjusted standardized hazard ratio [95% CI]=1.33 [1.18-1.50] and 1.15 [1.02-1.30], respectively), whereas the second factor had a J-shaped relationship, with a nadir corresponding to a brachial diastolic BP of ≈75 mm Hg. In conclusion, BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection are prognostically meaningful, distinct aspects of arterial function that can be used to summarize physiological variations in multiple arterial waveform parameters and identify truly cumulative associations when used as cardiovascular risk outcomes. © 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; hypertension; principal component analysis; risk","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Arterial Pressure; Brachial Artery; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; antihypertensive agent; aged; arterial pressure; brachial artery; controlled study; drug effect; female; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; pulse wave; randomized controlled trial; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072133193"

We have developed a new algorithm that accounts for arrhythmia-induced pulse pressure changes, allowing us to isolate and quantify ventilation-induced pulse pressure variation (VPPV). The robustness of the algorithm was tested in patients subjected to altered loading conditions. We investigated whether changes in VPPV imposed by passive leg raising (PLR) were proportional to the pre-PLR values. Methods: Consenting patients with active AF scheduled for an ablation of the pulmonary vein under general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation were included. Loading conditions were altered by PLR. ECG and invasive pressure data were acquired during 60 s periods before and after PLR. A generalised additive model was constructed for each patient on each observation period. The impact of AF was modelled on the two preceding RR intervals of each beat (RR0 and RR–1). The impact of ventilation and the long-term pulse pressure trends were modelled as separate splines. Ventilation-induced pulse pressure variation was defined as the percentage of the maximal change in pulse pressure during the ventilation cycle. Results: Nine patients were studied. The predictive abilities of the models had a median r2 of 0.92 (inter-quartile range: 89.2–94.2). Pre-PLR VPPV ranged from 0.1% to 27.9%. After PLR, VPPV decreased to 0–11.3% (P<0.014). The relation between the Pre-PLR values and the magnitude of the changes imposed by the PLR was statistically significant (P<0.001). Conclusions: Our algorithm enables quantification of VPPV in patients with AF with the ability to detect changing loading conditions. © 2020 British Journal of Anaesthesia","algorithm; atrial fibrillation; cardiopulmonary interaction; dynamic filling parameter; haemodynamic; mechanical ventilation; pulse pressure variation","Aged; Algorithms; Atrial Fibrillation; Blood Pressure; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Respiration, Artificial; amiodarone; angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; cisatracurium; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; flecainide; propofol; sevoflurane; sufentanil; ablation therapy; adult; aged; analgesia; anesthesia induction; Article; artificial ventilation; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure variability; bolus injection; cardiopulmonary function; classification algorithm; clinical article; data analysis software; electrocardiogram; female; general anesthesia; human; leg movement; male; observational study; passive movement; positive end expiratory pressure ventilation; predictive value; priority journal; proof of concept; pulmonary vein; pulse pressure; RR interval; algorithm; artificial ventilation; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure; electrocardiography; heart; lung; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85095782040"

Therefore, the primary causes of hypertension need to be identified so they may be addressed for treatment. The purpose of this study was to compare blood pressure with hemodynamic values and identify factors that may explain blood pressure differences between a cohort of healthy normotensive younger and older women. Methods: Participants were 49 young (age: 33.8 ± 5.9) and 103 old (age: 65.8 ± 4) who were non-hypertensive, had no previous history of heart disease or type 2 diabetes, body mass index less than 30 kg/m2, normal electrocardiography response at rest and during exercise, nonsmokers, and no use of medications known to affect cardiovascular or metabolic function. Body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Hemodynamic values measured by non-invasive pulse wave velocity through radial artery tonometry. Markers of inflammation measured through blood sample analysis. Results: Significant differences exist between young and old groups in %fat (P < 0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P = 0.001), large artery elasticity (P = 0.005), small artery elasticity (P < 0.001), systemic vascular resistance (P = 0.004), total vascular impedance (P < 0.001), estimated cardiac output (P < 0.001), and tumor necrosis factor-⍺ (TNF-⍺) (P < 0.001). Using ANCOVA the difference in SBP between age groups was no longer significant after adjusting for small artery elasticity (P < 0.001) and TNF-⍺ (P = 0.041). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that blood pressure and vascular hemodynamic measures differ significantly between young and old women independent of body composition. Furthermore, these differences may be explained by the inflammation marker TNF-⍺ and/or small artery elasticity. © 2021, The Author(s).","Arteries; Blood pressure; Hemodynamics; Inflammation","biological marker; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; blood pressure variability; body composition; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; elasticity; electrocardiography; female; heart hemodynamics; heart output; human; major clinical study; normal human; pulse wave velocity; secondary analysis; systemic vascular resistance; systolic blood pressure; tonometry; vascular resistance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119366457"

We examined the association of parathyroid hormone with central blood pressure and its determinants in 622 normotensive or never-treated hypertensive subjects aged 19–72 years without diabetes, cardiovascular or renal disease, or cardiovascular medications. The methods were whole-body impedance cardiography and analyses of pulse wave and heart rate variability. Cardiovascular function was examined in sex-specific tertiles of plasma parathyroid hormone (mean concentrations 3.0, 4.3 and 6.5 pmol/L, respectively) during head-up tilt. Explanatory factors for haemodynamics were further investigated using linear regression analyses. Mean age was 45.0 (s.d. 11.7) years, BMI 26.8 (4.4) kg/m2, seated office blood pressure 141/90 (21/12) mmHg, and 309 subjects (49.7%) were male. Only five participants had elevated plasma parathyroid hormone and calcium concentrations. Highest tertile of parathyroid hormone presented with higher supine and upright aortic diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01) and augmentation index (P < 0.01), and higher upright systemic vascular resistance (P < 0.05) than the lowest tertile. The tertiles did not present with differences in pulse wave velocity, cardiac output, or measures of heart rate variability. In linear regression analyses, parathyroid hormone was an independent explanatory factor for aortic systolic (P = 0.005) and diastolic (P = 0.002) blood pressure, augmentation index (P = 0.002), and systemic vascular resistance (P = 0.031). To conclude, parathyroid hormone was directly related to central blood pressure, wave reflection, and systemic vascular resistance in subjects without cardiovascular comorbidities and medications. Thus, parathyroid hormone may play a role in the pathophysiology of primary hypertension. © 2021 The authors Published by Bioscientifica Ltd.","Augmentation index; Blood pressure; Parathyroid hormone; Vascular resistance","25 hydroxyvitamin D; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; calcium; carboxy terminal telopeptide; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; parathyroid hormone; phosphate; triacylglycerol; uric acid; vitamin D; adult; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure; cardiography; cardiovascular function; chronic kidney failure; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; essential hypertension; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart rhythm; heart stroke volume; human; impedance cardiography; major clinical study; male; obesity; pathophysiology; phosphate blood level; post hoc analysis; pulse wave; pulse wave velocity; supine position; systemic vascular resistance; systolic blood pressure; tonometry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102521759"

Recent advances in image segmentation have made subject-specific modelling of the cardiovascular system a feasible task, which is particularly important in the case of pulmonary hypertension, requiring a combination of invasive and non-invasive procedures for diagnosis. Uncertainty in image segmentation propagates to CFD model predictions, making the quantification of segmentation-induced uncertainty crucial for subject-specific models. This study quantifies the variability of one-dimensional CFD predictions by propagating the uncertainty of network geometry and connectivity to blood pressure and flow predictions. We analyse multiple segmentations of a single, excised mouse lung using different pre-segmentation parameters. A custom algorithm extracts vessel length, vessel radii and network connectivity for each segmented pulmonary network. Probability density functions are computed for vessel radius and length and then sampled to propagate uncertainties to haemodynamic predictions in a fixed network. In addition, we compute the uncertainty of model predictions to changes in network size and connectivity. Results show that variation in network connectivity is a larger contributor to haemodynamic uncertainty than vessel radius and length. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We examined 200 class II hypertensive patients with obesity I-II degrees aged 45-55. Anthropometric, biochemical, automated methods of immune analysis, spectrophotometric, molecular genetic methods, instrumental, statistical methods were used. It was established, in obese hypertensive patients, the presence of G/T + T/T genotypes G276T of the ADIPOQ gene was associated with higher levels of aldosterone and plasma renin activity (PRA), more pronounced adipokine and carbohydrate imbalance, decreased overall antioxidant protection, increased levels of malonic dialdehyde (MDA), diene conjugates (DC), triglycerides and intima-media thickness (CIMT), an increase of the pulse wave velocity of carotid artery (cPWV) compared with carriers of G/G genotype. Carriers of G/R + R/R genotypes G972R of the IRS-1 gene, along with the above mentioned changes in parameters, are characterized by an additional decrease in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD) and an increase in plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and also interleukin - 6 (IL-6). The presence of combination of G/T + T/T genotypes G276T of the ADIPOQ gene with G/R + R/R genotypes G972R of the IRS-1 gene is associated with more pronounced negative changes in neurohumoral parameters and indicators of cardiovascular remodeling compared with patients, carrying a combination of G/G genotypes of both polymorphic markers. Thus, the study found that in patients of the Ukrainian population with AH and OB, polymorphisms G276T of the ADIPOQ gene and G972R of the IRS-1 gene are associated with profound neurohumoral disorders and, to a greater extent, with the progression of vascular remodeling than the cardiac one. © 2021 Ministry of Health.

Background: Although the variability in LVOT gradients in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is well known, the predictors of such variation are not. We hypothesized that quantitative invasive analysis of gradient variation could identify useful predictors of maximal gradients. Methods: Variability in continuously recorded, high-fidelity left ventricular and aortic pressure waveforms were evaluated by computer-assisted analysis in the resting state (N = 659 beats) and during supine exercise (N = 379 beats) in a symptomatic patient with a resting LVOT gradient >30 mmHg and frequent ventricular ectopy. Results: At rest, the peak left ventricular and aortic pressures at the time of the peak instantaneous LVOT gradient for all sinus and postectopic beats followed consistent regression slopes characterizing the potential energy loss between the LV cavity and aorta. During exercise, similar regression slopes were identified, and these converged with the resting slopes at the point of the maximal measured LVOT gradient. Component analysis of the LVOT gradient suggests that resting beat-to-beat variability provides information similar to post-ectopic pressures for predicting maximal gradients in obstructive-variant HCM. Conclusions: Our study suggests that computer-assisted analysis of hemodynamic variability in HCM may prove useful in characterizing the severity of obstruction. Further study is warranted to confirm the reproducibility and utility of this finding in a population with clinically significant exercise-induced gradients. © 2018 The Authors.

Pleth Variability Index (PVI) has been proposed as a noninvasive alternative. However, pneumoperitoneum has been recently suggested as a limitation to their interpretation. The aim of this study was to compare changes in ?PP and PVI related to autotransfusion associated with a Trendelenburg maneuver before and during pneumoperitoneum. Methods: 50 patients undergoing elective abdominal laparoscopic surgery were enrolled in this prospective observational study. All patients were equipped with an invasive radial artery catheter and a PVI probe. After obtaining a stable signal with both ?PP and PVI, baseline values were recorded, before and after head-down tilts of 10°, with or without abdominal insufflation (10-12 mmHg). All measurements were made before any fluid challenge under standardized anaesthesia, while patients were paralyzed and mechanically ventilated with 8 mL/kg tidal volume. Results: Changes in ?PP and PVI associated with the Trendelenburg maneuver before and after insufflation of the pneumoperitoneum were significantly different (P < 0.001). In baseline conditions, the Trendelenburg maneuver was associated with a significant decrease in heart rate while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Both ?PP and PVI decreased. After insufflation of the pneumoperitoneum, the Trendelenburg maneuver was associated with a significant decrease in heart rate and ?PP and an increase in mean arterial pressure while PVI remained unchanged. Conclusion: Pneumoperitoneum did not alter the response of ?PP to autotransfusion associated with the Trendelenburg maneuver, which was not the case for the PVI. This latter decreased during Trendelenburg maneuver performed alone and remained unchanged during Trendelenburg maneuver performed after insufflation of the pneumoperitoneum. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

However, lower body negative pressure, which increases sympathetic activity and has other hemodynamic effects, has a specific effect on PWV in healthy volunteers. Methods and Results: We examined effects of lower-limb venous occlusion (LVO), a similar intervention to lower-body negative pressure that reduces BP but increases sympathetic activity and device-guided breathing (DGB), which reduces both BP and sympathetic activity, on PWV in patients with essential hypertension (n=70 after LVO, n=45 after DGB and LVO in random order). The short-acting calcium channel antagonist nifedipine was used as a control for changes in BP. LVO produced a small but significant reduction in mean arterial pressure of 1.8 (95% CI 0.3–3.4) mm Hg. Despite this, aortic and carotid-femoral PWV increased during LVO by 0.8 (0.2–1.4) m/s and 0.7 (0.3–1.05) m/s, respectively. DGB reduced PWV by 1.2 (0.9–1.4) m/s, to a greater extent than did nifedipine 10 mg (reduction of 0.7 [0.1–1.3] m/s, P<0.05 compared with reduction during DGB). This occurred despite a greater decrease in BP with nifedipine compared with DGB. Conclusions: Arterial stiffness can be modulated independently of BP over the short term. The mechanism could involve alterations in sympathetic activity or other as yet uncharacterized effects of LVO and DGB. © 2019 The Authors.

Sixty-two patients referred for invasive hemodynamic evaluation were consecutively recruited. Simultaneously, the registration of the aortic pressure using a fluid-filled catheter, brachial pressure and radial tonometric waveform was recorded. Accordingly, the GTF device and mathematical model were set. Radial invasive pressure was recorded soon after aortic measurement. The average invasive aortic pressure was 141.3 ± 20.2/76 ± 12.2 mm Hg. The simultaneous brachial pressure was 144 ± 17.8/81.5 ± 11.7 mm Hg. The GTF-based and model-based aortic pressure estimates were 133.1 ± 17.3/82.4 ± 12 and 137 ± 21.6/72.2 ± 16.7 mm Hg, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots showed a marked tendency to pressure overestimation for increasing absolute values, with the exclusion of mathematical model diastolic estimations. The systolic pressure was increased from the aortic to radial locations (7.5 ± 19 mm Hg), while the diastolic pressure was decreased (3.8 ± 9.8 mm Hg). The brachial pressure underestimated the systolic and overestimated diastolic intra-arterial radial pressure. GTF errors were independently correlated with the variability in pulse pressure amplification and with the brachial error. Errors of the mathematical model were related to only demographic and clinical conditions. Neither a multiscale mathematical model nor a generalized transfer function device substantially outperformed the oscillometric brachial pressure in the estimation of aortic pressure. Mathematical modeling should be improved by including further patient-specific conditions, while the variability in pulse pressure amplification may hamper the performance of the GTF method in patients at the risk of coronary artery disease. © 2018, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","Aortic pressure; Generalized transfer function; Hypertension; Mathematical modeling; Pulse pressure amplification","Aged; Arterial Pressure; Catheterization; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Cardiovascular; adult; aortic invasive pressure; aortic pressure; aortic regurgitation; artery catheterization; Article; biomechanics; blood pressure; brachial non invasive pressure; cardiovascular parameters; coronary artery disease; echocardiography; geometry; ground reaction force; heart rate; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle ejection time; hemodynamics; human; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; mean arterial pressure; middle aged; non invasive procedure; oscillometric brachial pressure; oscillometry; pressure amplification; pulse wave; sphygmomanometry; tonometry; waveform; aged; arterial pressure; biological model; catheterization; comparative study; female","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85058167957"

The ability to carry out immediate adjusts in cardiovascular system, mainly mediated by the autonomic nervous system, is essential to the maintenance of hemodynamic stability during HD. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the sympathetic activity, and the hemodynamic stability from chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients during the HD, as well as the relationship between sympathetic activity and the uremic state. Methods: Fourteen CKD patients (8 women and 6 men) with no history of recurrent intradialytic hypotension (ID) episodes had the successive RR intervals recorded during HD. Blood pressure measurements were recorded at regular intervals of 30 minutes along 4 hours of each session. Hemodynamic stability was established by the standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV) and the Delta (difference between the highest and the lowest measure) of systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean (MBP) blood pressures, as well as the pulse pressure (PP) from the 8 recordings obtained during each session. As a measure of autonomic heart control, the low-transformed low frequency (lnLFnu) spectral band was used. The uremic state was established by the mean of uremia from the last 12 months. Pearson’s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between the studied variables. Results: The lnLFnu values were negatively associated SD (SBP [r = -0.480; p = 0.010], PP [r = -0.504; p = 0.006] and MBP [r = -0.449; p = 0.017]), CV (SBP [r = -0.390; p = 0.040]) and delta (SBP [r = -0.438; p = 0.020], PP [r = -0.490; p = 0.008] and MBP [r = -0.382; p = 0.045]). lnLFnu was also negatively associated to the uremic state (r = -0.601; p = 0.01). Conclusions: Our results indicate that higher values of the lnLFnu are associated with better hemodynamic stability (i.e., smaller blood pressure oscillations) during HD sessions, in turn, the mean of blood urea concentration in the last 12 months, defined here as the uremic state, was associated with lower values of the lnLFnu during HD sessions. © 2019, Asociacion Regional de Dialisi y Transplantes Renales de Capital Federal y Provincia de Buenos Aires.

Intriguing is furthermore, why some patients require no vasopressor medication to uphold mean arterial pressure, while others need vasopressor support. OBJECTIVE: Determination of macro-and microhemodynamic changes during induction of general anesthesia. METHODS: We enrolled 150 female adults scheduled for gynaecological surgery into this prospective observational, single-blinded trial. Besides routinely measuring heart rate (HR) and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), the non-invasive technique of thoracic electrical bioimpedance was applied to measure cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variability (SVV) and index of myocardial contractility (ICON) before induction of anesthesia, 7 times during induction, and, finally, after surgery in the recovery room. Changes in microcirculation were assessed using sidestream dark field imaging to establish the perfused boundary region (PBR), a validated gauge of glycocalyx health. Comparisons were made with Friedman's or Wilcoxon test for paired data, and with Mann-Whitney-U test for unpaired data, with post-hoc corrections for multiple measurements by the Holm-Bonferroni method. RESULTS: 83 patients did not need vasopressor support, whereas 67 patients required therapy (norepinephrine, atropine or cafedrine/theodrenaline) to elevate MAP values to ≥70mmHg during induction, 54 of these receiving norepinephrine (NE) alone. Pre-interventional (basal) values of CO, CI, ICON, SV and SVV were all significantly lower in the group of patients later requiring NE (p < 0.04), whereas HR and MAP were identical for both groups. HR, MAP and CO decreased from baseline to 12 min after induction of general anesthesia in both the patients without and those with NE support. Heart rate decreased significantly by about 25% in both groups (-19 to-21 bpm). The median individual decrease of MAP amounted to-26.7% (19.7/33.3, p < 0.001) and-26.1% (11.6/33.2, p < 0.001), respectively, whereas for CO it was-40.7% (34.1/50.1, p < 0.001) and-43.5% (34.8/48.7). While these relative changes did not differ between the two groups, in absolute values there were significantly greater decreases in CO, CI, SV and ICON in the group requiring NE. Noteably, NE did not restore ICON or the other cardiac parameters to levels approaching those of the group without NE. PBR was measured in a total of 84 patients compiled from both groups, there being no intergroup differences. It increased 6.4% (p < 0.001) from pre-induction to the end of the operation, indicative of damage to microvascular glycocalyx. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive determination of CO provides additional hemodynamic information during anesthesia, showing that induction results in a significant decrease not only of MAP but also of CO and other cardiac factors at all timepoints compared to baseline values. The decrease of CO was greater than that of MAP and, in contrast to MAP, did not respond to NE. There was also no sign of a positive inotropic effect of NE in this situation. Support of MAP by NE must consequently result from an increase in peripheral arterial resistance, posing a risk for oxygen supply to tissue. In addition, general anesthesia and the operative stimulus lead to an impairment of the microcirculation.  © 2021-IOS Press.

However, their utility in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is unclear. Methods: The ACS-BP study is a single-centre observational cohort study designed to investigate the prognostic role of haemodynamic load and arterial stiffness indices for cardio-renal outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). All consecutive patients admitted with a diagnosis of acute AMI with or without ST segment elevation were screened for inclusion in the study. The management of AMI will follow current guidelines. Results and Discussion: Data from baseline clinical and laboratory parameters during their hospitalization were collected. The haemodynamic load of each patient was determined by clinical BP values as well as 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. The AASI was calculated from the raw 24-h BP data and ABI was measured after the third day of hospitalization using a certified device.

The pulsatile component of PPG waveform (AC) is attributed to cardiac synchronous changes in the blood volume with each heartbeat and is superimposed on a slowly varying baseline (DC) component that is attributed to respiration, sympathetic nervous system activity, and thermoregulation. In current pulse oximetry devices, the PPG signal is optimized (amplified and highly filtered) to accentuate its pulsatile component. Pulse oximeters have been used in commercially available medical devices for measuring oxygen saturation and heart rate. The utilization of powerful methods of digital signal processing allows for uncovering the true potential of the PPG waveform in order to guide early goal-directed therapeutic interventions (fluid, vasopressors, and inotropes), to assess of vascular compliance and autonomic function, and to estimate of respiratory rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The duplex scanner combined real-time two-dimensional B-mode imaging and pulsed-Doppler flow detection in a single instrument and provided Doppler spectral waveforms from discrete sites within the vessel lumen. Spectral waveforms allowed characterization of the flow patterns and velocity changes associated with normal and diseased arteries. In a series of validation studies, Dr. D. Eugene Strandness, Jr. and colleagues compared various spectral waveform parameters obtained from internal carotid arteries to independently read carotid arteriograms and established quantitative threshold criteria for classification of carotid artery disease. These criteria were based on peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity, as well as features such as spectral broadening and flow separation. Internal carotid arteries were classified as normal, 1% to 15% diameter reduction, 16% to 49% diameter reduction, 50% to 79% diameter reduction, 80% to 99% diameter reduction, and occluded. Since the 1980s, the University of Washington carotid duplex criteria have been widely used and modified in vascular laboratories throughout the world. Additional clinically relevant criteria have also been developed, such as a threshold for the 70% to 99% North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) stenosis. Validation of carotid criteria has always depended on comparing spectral waveform parameters to the “gold standard” of contrast arteriography. However, experience has shown that the relationship between velocity and arteriographic stenosis is subject to significant variability. Based on these observations, standardization of carotid duplex criteria should lead to more consistent reporting among vascular laboratories, but it is unlikely to result in improved correlation with arteriography. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","","Blood Flow Velocity; Carotid Artery, Internal; Carotid Stenosis; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Regional Blood Flow; Severity of Illness Index; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Duplex; Article; B scan; carotid arteriography; carotid artery disease; carotid artery obstruction; color flow Doppler imaging; color flow imaging; disease severity; echography; end diastolic velocity; hemodynamic parameters; human; internal carotid artery; non invasive procedure; peak systolic velocity; periorbital Doppler examination; pressure oculoplethysmography; priority journal; pulse delay oculoplethysmography; spectral waveform; spectral waveform analysis; supraorbital photoplethysmography; ultrasonic arteriography; waveform; blood flow; blood flow velocity; diagnostic imaging; duplex Doppler ultrasonography; history; pathophysiology; predictive value; prognosis; severity of illness index","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088146633"

We here investigated the capacity of a new hemodynamic parameter, the venous Pulse Wave Velocity (vPWV), to detect the effect of passive leg raising (PLR). Materials and methods: In 15 healthy volunteers (7 M, 8 F, age 26 ± 3) venous pressure pulses were elicited by pneumatic compressions of the left hand and proximally detected by ultrasound for calculation of the vPWV. We also non-invasively measured the basilic vein (BV) cross-sectional perimeter, and peripheral venous pressure (PVP). The PLR manoeuvre was performed twice to evaluate reliability of the assessment. Results: The PLR had an overall statistically significant effect on the entire set of variables (MANOVA, p < 0.05): vPWV increased from 2.11 ± 0.46 to 2.30 ± 0.47 m/s (p = 0.01; average increase: 10%). This effect was transient and dropped below 5% after about 3 min. A significant increase was also exhibited by BV size and PVP. In consecutive measurements vPWV showed little intra-subject variability (CoV = 8%) and good reliability (ICC = 0.87). Finally, the vPWV responses to the two PLRs exhibited good agreement (paired T-test: p = 0.96), and moderate reliability (ICC = 0.57). Conclusion: These results demonstrated that vPWV can be non-invasively, objectively and reliably measured in healthy subjects and that it is adequate to detect small pressure/volume variations, as induced by PLR-from-supine. These characteristics make it suitable for clinical applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Passive leg raising; Venous return; Vessel stiffness; Volume status","Blood pressure; Reliability; Ultrasonic applications; Wave propagation; Clinical application; Clinical settings; Consecutive measurements; Healthy subjects; Healthy volunteers; Hemodynamic parameters; Pulse wave velocity; Simulated fluids; adult; Article; basilic vein; body position; Doppler flowmetry; evaluation study; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; passive leg raising; peripheral vein; priority journal; pulse wave velocity; vein; vein diameter; venous pressure; venous pulse wave velocity; venous return; Acoustic wave velocity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090031759"

To study the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid hormones (TH), frequency and amplitude parameters of alpha wave, parameters of heart rate variability, hemodynamics and their relationship in patients with hypertension (HTN) and healthy individuals. Material and methods. We studied 75 patients with stage 2 HTN and 70 healthy individuals. All patients underwent an electroencephalography, 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. Weighted average heart rate variability was calculated. We determined blood plasma levels of TSH and TH. Statistical processing, multiple regression and correlation analysis were carried out using the Statistica v. 10.0.1 software package (StatSoft Inc). Results. In patients with HTN, TSH and TH were lower than in the control group by 50% and 38%, respectively. The α-index was also 40% lower. Patients with HTN were characterized by lower amplitude, frequency and power of α-wave, and weighted average heart rate variability by 35%, 13-35%, and 30%, respectively. Pulse wave velocity in patients with HTN exceeded the control group by 18%, and the systemic dynamic response was 2,2 times higher. The groups differed in the characteristics of the relationship of α-wave between the brain lobes and hemispheres with TSH, TH, heart rate variability and hemodynamics. Conclusion. The concentration of TSH and TH is interrelated with the frequency and amplitude parameters of alpha wave, heart rate variability and hemodynamic parameters in hypertensive patients. © 2021 Vserossiiskoe Obshchestvo Kardiologov.

The interactions between task-evoked brain responses and the spontaneous cortical oscillations, especially within the low frequency range of ~0.1 ​Hz, are not fully understood. Trial-to-trial variabilities in brain's response to sensory stimuli and the ability for brain to detect under noisy conditions suggest an appreciable impact of the brain state. Using a multimodality imaging platform, we simultaneously imaged neuronal Ca2+ and cerebral hemodynamics at baseline and in response to single-pulse forepaw stimuli in rat's somatosensory cortex. The high sensitivity of this system enables detection of responses to very weak and strong stimuli and real time determination of low frequency oscillations without averaging. Results show that the ongoing neuronal oscillations inversely modulate Ca2+ transients evoked by sensory stimuli. High intensity stimuli reset the spontaneous neuronal oscillations to an unpreferable excitability following the stimulus. Cerebral hemodynamic responses also inversely interact with the spontaneous hemodynamic oscillations, correlating with the neuronal Ca2+ transient changes. The results reveal competing interactions between spontaneous oscillations and stimulation-evoked brain activities in somatosensory cortex and the resultant hemodynamics. © 2020","","Animals; Brain Waves; Calcium; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Forelimb; Functional Neuroimaging; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Multimodal Imaging; Neurovascular Coupling; Optical Imaging; Physical Stimulation; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Somatosensory Cortex; calcium ion; calcium; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; body temperature; breathing rate; calcium signaling; controlled study; cortical excitability; evoked cortical response; hemodynamics; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; local field potential; male; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; oscillation; priority journal; rat; resting state network; sensory stimulation; somatosensory cortex; spontaneous low frequency oscillation; animal; electroencephalogram; fluorescence imaging; forelimb; functional neuroimaging; multimodal imaging; neurovascular coupling; physical stimulation; physiology; procedures; somatosensory evoked potential; Sprague Dawley rat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078666319"

The haemodynamic effects of the two fluid regimens may increase our understanding of the observed perioperative outcomes. Methods: Stroke volume and cardiac output were measured with both an oesophageal Doppler ultrasound monitor and arterial pressure waveform analysis. Stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, and plethysmographic variability index were also obtained. A passive leg raise manoeuvre was performed to identify fluid responsiveness. Results: Analysis of 105 patients showed that the primary outcome, Doppler monitor-derived stroke volume index, was higher in the liberal group: restrictive 38.5 (28.6–48.8) vs liberal 44.0 (34.9–61.9) ml m−2; P=0.043. Similarly, there was a higher cardiac index in the liberal group: 2.96 (2.32–4.05) vs 2.42 (1.94–3.26) L min−1 m−2; P=0.015. Arterial-pressure-based stroke volume and cardiac index did not differ, nor was there a significant difference in stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation, or plethysmographic variability index. The passive leg raise manoeuvre showed fluid responsiveness in 40% of restrictive and 30% of liberal protocol patients (not significant). Conclusions: The liberal fluid group from the RELIEF trial had significantly higher Doppler ultrasound monitor-derived stroke volume and cardiac output compared with the restrictive fluid group at the end of the intraoperative period.

Recently, a smartphone application (Capstesia™), which automatically calculates PPV from a picture of the invasive arterial pressure waveform from any monitor screen (PPVCAP), has been developed. The purpose of this study was to compare PPVCAP with SVV from an uncalibrated pulse wave analysis monitor (SVVPC). In 40 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, we compared PPVCAP with SVVPC at post-induction, pre-incision, post-incision, end of surgery, and during every hypotensive episode (mean arterial pressure < 65 mmHg). We classified PPVCAP and SVVPC into three categories reflecting the thresholds used for the decision to administer fluids: no fluid administration (PPV and SVV < 9%), gray zone (PPV and SVV 9–13%), and fluid administration (PPV and SVV > 13%). The agreement between SVVPC and PPVCAP for these three categories was measured by the number of concordant paired measurements divided by the total number of paired measurements and Cohen’s kappa coefficient. In the 549 pairs of PPV–SVV data obtained, the overall agreement of PPVCAP with SVVPC was 79%, and the kappa coefficient was moderate (0.55). The highest agreement and kappa coefficient value were observed after the induction of anesthesia before surgical incision. PPVCAP and SVVPC would have resulted in completely opposite clinical decisions regarding fluid administration in 1% of the cases. In this clinical decision making study in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, we observed a moderate agreement between PPVCAP and SVVPC with regard to categories used to guide fluid administration.

The association between day-by-day home BP variability and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) as an index of cardiac overload may be amplified by increased arterial stiffness as assessed by brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). J-HOP (Japan Morning Surge-Home Blood Pressure) Study participants who were selected from a practitioner-based population with at least one cardiovascular risk factor underwent home BP monitoring, and their BP levels and SD, coefficient of variation, and average real variability as indexes of systolic BP variability were assessed. We analyzed 2115 individuals without prevalent heart failure and divided them into lower (<1800 cm/s, n=1464) and higher (≥1800 cm/s, n=651) baPWV groups. The higher baPWV group had significantly higher SDSBP, CVSBP, ARVSBPvalues, and NT-proBNP levels than the lower baPWV group (all P<0.001). In the higher baPWV group, a multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the SDSBPwas associated with the NT-proBNP level after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors including the average home systolic BP (coefficient per 1 SD increase, 0.049 [95% CI, 0.018-0.081]; P=0.002). Similar trends were found for CVSBP(P=0.003) and ARVSBP(P=0.004). However, these associations were not found in the lower baPWV group. There was an interaction between all indexes of systolic BP variability and the NT-proBNP level according to lower or higher baPWV group (all P<0.05).

Built upon a grey-box mathematical model with parametric uncertainty as process noise, the EKF can estimate cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) continuously from mean arterial pressure (AP) measurements against inter-individual physiological and pharmacological variability. Its unique practical strengths include: it does not require AP waveform as in existing AP-based pulse-contour CO (PCCO) monitors; and it can estimate CO and TPR with explicit account for the effect of sedative drugs. The efficacy of the EKF-based hemodynamic monitoring was evaluated based on a large number of plausible virtual patients generated using a collective inference algorithm, which demonstrated that it has significant advantage over open-loop pure prediction, and that its accuracy is comparable to PCCO.  © 2017 IEEE.","Extended Kalman filtering; hemodynamic monitoring; hemorrhage; sedation; virtual patient","Blood pressure; Estimation; Extended Kalman filters; Inference engines; Monitoring; Physiological models; Uncertainty analysis; Biomedical monitoring; Extended Kalman filtering; Generator; Haemodynamics; Haemorrage; Hemodynamic monitoring; Hemorrhaging; Sedation; Virtual patient.; Virtual patients; Hemodynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127781009"

However, it is not clear that which exercise training variables, intensity or volume, or both, play a crucial role in this regard. This study investigates the chronic effects of high-volume moderate-intensity training (HVMIT) and low-volume high-intensity training (LVHIT) on heart rate variability (HRV) and AS in sedentary adult men. Materials and Methods: Notably, 45 males (age: 42 ± 5.7 years) were randomly assigned to a control (n = 15), HVMIT (n = 15), or LVHIT (n = 15). The HVMIT group ran three times per week on a treadmill at 50–60% of VO2max for 45–60 min, while the LVHIT trained at 70–85% of VO2max for 25–40 min. Both training protocols were equated by caloric expenditure. HRV, pulse wave velocity (PWV), hemodynamic variables, and body composition were measured before and after 12 weeks. Results: Both protocols (i.e., HVMIT and LVHIT) significantly increased the SD of normal sinus beat intervals (SDNN) and high-frequency (HF) bands (p < 0.05) after 12 weeks. Whereas the low-frequency (LF)-HF ratio decreased significantly in both training protocols (p < 0.05); however, these changes were significantly greater in the LVHIT protocol (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (RMSSD) significantly increased only in the LVHIT (p < 0.05). Moreover, a significant decrease in LF and PWV was only observed following the LVHIT protocol (p < 0.05). Some measures of HRV and PWV were significantly correlated (r = 0.275–0.559; p < 0.05). Conclusion: These results show that the LVHIT protocol was more efficient for improving HRV variables and PWV than the HVMIT protocol after 12 weeks of continuous running training. Interestingly, changes in some HRV parameters were related to changes in PWV. Further studies should elaborate on the link between central and peripheral cardiovascular adaptations after continuous and intermittent training regimens differing in intensity.

However, pediatric patients with cirrhosis may present with unique hemodynamic characteristics, and therefore, the predictive accuracy of these variables in such patients must be clarified. Aims: To investigate the accuracy of dynamic preload variables for predicting fluid responsiveness in pediatric patients with cirrhosis. Methods: A total of 27 pediatric patients with cirrhosis undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation were enrolled in this study. Patients’ pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, stroke volume index, and central venous pressure were measured using the calibrated pulse contour cardiac output system. The plethysmographic variability index was measured using a Masimo Radical 7 co-oximeter. During the hepatic dissection phase of the surgery, repeated intraoperative fluid challenges with 10 mL kg−1 of crystalloid within 15 minutes were administered. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in stroke volume index of ≥15% after fluid challenge. Results: A total of 61 fluid challenges were administered resulting in 15 fluid responders and 46 fluid nonresponders. Fluid challenge induced significant decreases in all three dynamic preload variables but not in the fluid nonresponders. However, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, plethysmographic variability index, and central venous pressure for predicting fluid responsiveness were 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.52-0.82; P =.0255), 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.54-0.83; P =.0140), 0.56 (95% confidence interval: 0.40-0.71; P =.4724), and 0.57 (95% confidence interval: 0.40-0.74; P =.4192), respectively.

Although changes in VS can reflect infant physiology or circadian rhythms, persistent deviations in absolute values or complex changes in variability can indicate acute or chronic pathology. Recent studies demonstrate that analysis of continuous VS trends can predict sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, brain injury, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cardiorespiratory decompensation, and mortality. Subtle changes in continuous VS patterns may not be discerned even by experienced clinicians reviewing spot VS data or VS trends captured in the monitor. In contrast, objective analysis of continuous VS data can improve neonatal outcomes by allowing heightened vigilance or preemptive interventions. In this review, we provide an overview of the studies that have used continuous analysis of single or multiple VS, their interactions, and combined VS and clinical analytic tools, to predict or detect neonatal pathophysiology. We make the case that big-data analytics are promising, and with continued improvements, can become a powerful tool to mitigate neonatal diseases in the twenty-first century. © 2019, International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.","","Big Data; Birth Weight; Blood Pressure; Gestational Age; Heart Rate; Hemodynamic Monitoring; Hemodynamics; Humans; Infant, Extremely Premature; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Oximetry; Oxygen; Predictive Value of Tests; Respiratory Rate; Vital Signs; oxygen; big data; blood pressure monitoring; breathing rate; clinical outcome; deterioration; heart rate; human; hypotension; infection; newborn; newborn disease; oxygen saturation; pathophysiology; prematurity; priority journal; pulse oximetry; Review; sepsis; vital sign; birth weight; blood; blood pressure; gestational age; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; low birth weight; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn disease; oximetry; predictive value","Review","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85071073756"

Nevertheless, despite having newer models based on time-dependent momentum balance across an orifice, the simplified and modified Bernoulli continue to be the clinical standard because to date, they remain the only models clinically implementable. The objective of this study is to (1) illustrate the fundamental considerations necessary to accurately model the time-dependent instantaneous pressure gradient across a fixed orifice and (2) propose empirical corrections when applying orifice based models to severely stenotic aortic valves. We introduce a general model to predict the time-dependent instantaneous pressure gradient across an orifice that explicitly model the Reynolds number dependence of both the steady and unsteady terms. The accuracy of this general model is assessed with respect to previous models through pulse duplicator experiments on a round orifice model as well as an explanted stenotic surgical aortic valve both with geometric areas of 0.6 cm2 (less than 1 cm2 which is the threshold for stenosis determination) over cardiac outputs of 3 and 5 L/min and heart rates of 60, 90 and 120 bpm. The model and the raw experimental data corresponding to the orifice showed good agreement over a wide range of cardiac outputs and heart rates (R2 exceeding 0.91). The derived average and peak transvalvular pressure gradients also demonstrated good agreement with no significant differences between the respective peaks (p > 0.09). The new model proposed holds promise with its physical and closed form representation of pressure drop, however accurate modeling of the time-variability of the valve area is necessary for the model to be applied on stenotic valves. © 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Aortic stenosis; Bernoulli equation; Flow unsteadiness; Pressure gradient; Reynolds number","Aortic Valve; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Cardiac Output; Hemodynamics; Humans; Models, Cardiovascular; Pressure; Blood vessels; Diseases; Heart; Hemodynamics; Orifices; Reynolds number; Aortic stenosis; Bernoulli equations; Closed-form representations; Flow unsteadiness; Instantaneous pressures; Momentum balances; Simplifying assumptions; Transvalvular pressure gradients; aortic stenosis; Article; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; flow rate; geometry; heart output; heart rate measurement; hemodynamic parameters; prediction; pressure gradient; priority journal; systole; aortic valve; aortic valve stenosis; biological model; hemodynamics; human; pathophysiology; pressure; Pressure gradient","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065176580"

However, high Body Mass Index (BMI) can restrict their use due to changes in respiratory system compliance (CS), intra-abdominal pressure, and stroke volume (SV) in the prone position. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of mini-fluid challenge (MFC) in predicting fluid responsiveness in obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) patients in the prone position. METHODS: A total of 33 patients undergoing neurosurgery were included. After standardized anesthesia induction, patients’ PPV, SVV, stroke volume index (SVI) and CS values were recorded in the prone position (T1), after the infusion of 100 mL of crystalloid named as MFC (T2) and after fluid loading was completed with additional 400 mL of crystalloid. Patients whose SVI increased more than 15% after the fluid loading were defined as volume responders. RESULTS: Fifteen (45%) patients were responders to 500 mL fluid loading. After the 100 mL fluid load, a higher percentage increase in SVI was observed among responders (P<0.001), with values of 6.6% (6.2-8.6%) and 3.5% (1.7-4.8%) in responders and non-responders, respectively. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of MFC, PPV, and SVV were 0.967 (95% CI: 0.838-0.999), 0.683 (95% CI: 0.499-0.834), and 0.709 (95% CI: 0.526-0.853), respectively. The area under the curve of MFC was significantly higher than that of PPV (P=0.003) and SVV (P=0.005).

We aimed to investigate which cardiovascular markers were most closely linked to an impaired glucose control. Method: In a population-based study of individuals all aged 50 years, the Prospective study of Obesity, Energy and Metabolism (POEM), 502 subjects were thoroughly investigated regarding endothelial function, arterial compliance, heart rate variability, arterial blood flow and atherosclerosis, performance at an exercise test with gas exchange (VO2 and VCO2), left ventricular structure and function, lung function and multiple measurements of blood pressure. Based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the participants were grouped into normal, IGT and diabetes. Results: Of all haemodynamic and structural variables analysed, an impaired glucose control was most closely related to resting heart rate (based on chi-square value at ANOVA). Heart rate was followed by maximal workload, VO2 recovery 5 min following exercise, reflectance index at pulse wave analysis, manual systolic blood pressure, ambulatory pulse and pulse pressure, echogenicity of carotid intima-media complex at ultrasound, and pulse wave velocity (p <.0005 for all variables). All of these variables still showed p <.05 versus an impaired glucose control following adjustment for BMI. Conclusion: Of multiple measured cardiovascular markers, resting heart rate was most closely related to an impaired glucose control.

However, their usefulness in patients with altered vascular compliance is uncertain. This study is the first to evaluate whether dynamic indices can reliably predict fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing liver transplantation with a high femoral-to-radial arterial pressure gradient (PG). Methods: Eighty liver transplant recipients were retrospectively categorized as having a normal (n = 56) or high (n = 24, difference in systolic pressure ≥ 10 mmHg and/or mean pressure ≥ 5 mmHg) femoral-to-radial arterial PG, measured immediately after radial and femoral arterial cannulation. The ability of dynamic preload indices (stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation [PPV], pleth variability index) to predict fluid responsiveness was assessed before the surgery. Fluid replacement of 500 ml of crystalloid solution was per-formed over 15 min. Fluid responsiveness was defined as ≥ 15% increase in the stroke volume index. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) indicated the prediction of fluid responsiveness. Results: Fourteen patients in the normal, and eight in the high PG group were fluid respond-ers. The AUCs for PPV in the normal, high PG groups and total patients were 0.702 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.553–0.851, P = 0.008), 0.633 (95% CI 0.384–0.881, P = 0.295) and 0.667 (95% CI 0.537–0.798, P = 0.012), respectively. No other index predicted fluid responsiveness.

The standardised mean difference pre- and post-race of various time-domain and frequency-domain indices of HRV, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was calculated. Regarding HRV, there was a significant decrease in most of the variables considered as markers of parasympathetic activity, indicating a shift of autonomic balance towards a reduced vagal tone. Regarding vascular variables, there was a significant drop in blood pressure and reduced AS. In conclusion, running an LDR seems to have a considerable acute effect on the autonomic nervous system, haemodynamics, and vascular properties. The observed effects could be categorised within the expected acute responses to long-lasting, strenuous exercise. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","arterial stiffness; Autonomic nervous system; heart rate variability; long-distance races; running","Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Heart Rate; Humans; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vascular Stiffness; arterial stiffness; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; heart rate; human; meta analysis; physiology; pulse wave","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118471885"

The cbPPG signal is sourced from the cutaneous microcirculation, yields a 2-dimensional intensity map, and is therefore an interesting monitoring technique. In this study, we investigated whether cbPPG is in general sufficiently sensitive to discern hemodynamic conditions.Methods:cbPPG recordings of 70 patients recovering from cardiac surgery were analyzed. Photoplethysmograms were processed offline and the optical pulse power (OPP) of cardiac ejection was calculated. Hemodynamic data, image intensity, and patient movements were recorded synchronously. The effects of hemodynamic parameters and measurement conditions on the patient's individual OPP variability and their actual OPP values were calculated in mixed-effects regression models.Results:Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) significantly explained the individual OPP variability. PP had the highest explanatory power (19.9%). Averaged OPP significantly increased with PP and MAP (P<0.001, respectively) and decreased with higher HR (P=0.024). CVP had a 2-directional, nonsignificant effect on averaged OPP. Image intensity and patient movements did significantly affect OPP. After adjustment for hemodynamic covariables and measurement conditions, the effect of PP and HR remained unchanged, whereas that of MAP vanished.Conclusion:cbPPG is sensitive to hemodynamic parameters in critical care patients. It is a potential application for monitoring the peripheral circulation. Its value in a clinical setting has to be determined. © 2019 by the Shock Society.","Critical care; monitoring; peripheral circulation; remote photoplethysmography; videoplethysmography","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Central Venous Pressure; Critical Care; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Microcirculation; Middle Aged; Photoplethysmography; Regression Analysis; adult; article; central venous pressure; controlled study; female; heart rate; heart surgery; human; intensive care; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; peripheral circulation; photoelectric plethysmography; pulse pressure; remission; aged; blood pressure; hemodynamics; intensive care; microcirculation; middle aged; photoelectric plethysmography; physiology; procedures; regression analysis; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85069908408"

However, the degree to which differences between stimulation protocols impinge on cardiovascular outcomes has not been defined. To address this, we examined the effects of short- and long-duration (SD and LD) CS stimulation on hemodynamic and vascular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). We fit animals with miniature electrical stimulators coupled to electrodes positioned around the left CS nerve that delivered intermittent 5/25 s ON/OFF (SD) or 20/20 s ON/OFF (LD) square pulses (1 ms, 3 V, 30 Hz) continuously applied for 48 h in conscious animals. A sham-operated control group was also studied. We measured mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV), heart rate (HR), and heart rate variability (HRV) for 60 min before stimulation, 24 h into the protocol, and 60 min after stimulation had stopped. SD stimulation reversibly lowered MAP and HR during stimulation. LD stimulation evoked a decrease in MAP that was sustained even after stimulation was stopped. Neither SD nor LD had any effect on SBPV or HRV when recorded after stimulation, indicating no adaptation in autonomic activity. Both the contractile response to phenylephrine and the relaxation response to acetylcholine were increased in mesenteric resistance vessels isolated from LD-stimulated rats only. In conclusion, the ability of baroreflex activation to modulate hemodynamics and induce lasting vascular adaptation is critically dependent on the electrical parameters and duration of CS stimulation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Japanese Society of Hypertension.","Baroreceptors; Carotid sinus; Hypertension; Mesenteric resistance arterioles; Sympathetic activity","Animals; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Carotid Sinus; Electric Stimulation; Heart Rate; Hypertension; Rats; Rats, Inbred SHR; acetylcholine; phenylephrine; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood pressure; blood pressure variability; carotid sinus nerve; electrical parameters; electrostimulation; heart function; heart hemodynamics; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; mean arterial pressure; nonhuman; pressoreceptor reflex; rat; resistance blood vessel; spontaneously hypertensive rat; systolic blood pressure; animal; blood pressure; carotid sinus; electrostimulation; hypertension; spontaneously hypertensive rat","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102495176"

Methods This prospective study was conducted from September 2019 to September 2020. Sixty patients (39 males and 21 females, aged 60 - 70 years old, Grade II - III of American Society of Anesthesiologists) were enrolled in the First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College for laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery. Random-number table method was used to divide the patients into two groups. The observation group (30 cases) received fluid rehydration under the guidance of PVI, while the control group (30 cases) received fluid supplementation under the guidance of central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure. Patient PVI, perfusion index (PI), and patient status index (PSI) were continuously monitored using Masimo Radical-7 and SedLine, and PSI was maintained between 25 and 50 intra-operatively. The outcome measures were as follows: (1) The baseline data of the two groups were compared. (2) Peri-operative observation indicators, including intraoperative crystal input, colloidal input, total infusion volume, urine volume, extubation time, post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) time, observer's assessment of alertness / sedation (OAA / S) score, exhaust time, and length of hospital stay were observed;(3) Hemodynamics and volume indexes, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, PVI, PI, and central venous pressure of patients were observed at 6 min after admission (T0), 6 min after intubation (T1), skin incision (T2), gastrointestinal anastomosis (T3), and 6 min after extubation (T4) . (4) Inflammatory cytokines and arterial blood lactic acid indices, including C-reactive protein, endotoxin, procalcitonin, and lactic acid in plasma were observed before and at 1 and 3 days after surgery. Results (1) No significant difference was observed in the baseline data between the two groups (all P values > 0. 05) . (2) No statistically significant differences were observed in extubation time, PACU time, OAA / S score, and length of hospital stay between the two groups (all P values > 0. 05) . The crystal fluid volume, total infusion volume, urine volume, and exhaust time in the control group were significantly higher than those in the observation group, while the colloidal fluid volume was significantly lower than that in the observation group (all P values < 0. 05) . (3) No significant differences were observed in the heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and perfusion index between the two groups at different time (all P values > 0. 05) . The variation index of central venous pressure and pulse perfusion in the control group were higher than those in the observation group, the differences of the former at T2 and T4 and that of the latter at T1 and T4 were statistically significant (all P values < 0. 05) . Based on the comparison at different time points with each groups, no significant difference was observed in the perfusion index and heart rate of the control group and the average arterial pressure of the observation group (all P values > 0. 05) . Compared with T0 at each time point, the heart rate of observation group at T1-T3 gradually decreased but increased at T4. In the control group, the mean arterial pressure decreased at T1 and increased gradually at T2-T4. The central venous pressure in two groups decreased at T1 and gradually increased at T2-T4. The PVI at T1-T4 of two groups decreased gradually(all P values < 0. 05) . (4) The endotoxin, C-reactive protein, and lactic acid in two groups were higher than those before surgery 1 and 3 days after surgery, and the values from the control group were significantly higher than those from the observation group; the differences were statistically significant (all P values < 0. 05) . Conclusions The application of PVI monitoring in laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery can effectively guide fluid management, maintain appropriate circulation capacity and balance of tissue oxygen supply and demand, inhibit the inflammatory response of the body, and play a positive role in the rapid recovery of the body. © 2021 Authors.

Evidence on the relation of plasma calcium concentration with blood pressure (BP) is inconsistent and relies largely on studies utilizing office BP measurements in populations using cardiovascular drugs. In many studies adjustment for confounders was not optimal. In this cross-sectional study we examined the association of plasma total calcium concentration with the haemodynamic determinants of blood pressure. Subjects and methods: Supine haemodynamics were recorded using pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography, and heart rate variability analysis in 618 normotensive or never-treated hypertensive subjects (aged 19–72 years) without diabetes, cardiovascular or renal disease, or cardiovascular medications. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate factors associated with haemodynamic variables. Results: Mean age was 45.0 years, body mass index 26.8 kg/m2, seated office BP 141/89 mmHg, and 307 subjects (49.7%) were male. Mean values of routine blood and plasma chemistry analyses were within the reference limits of the tests except for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.05 mmol/l). In the laboratory, mean supine radial BP was 131/75 mmHg, and both systolic and diastolic BP correlated directly with plasma total calcium concentration (r = 0.25 and r = 0.22, respectively, p < 0.001 for both). In regression analysis plasma total calcium concentration was an independent explanatory variable for radial and aortic systolic and diastolic BP, and systemic vascular resistance, but not for cardiac output, pulse wave velocity, or any of the heart rate variability parameters. Conclusion: Plasma total calcium concentration was directly associated with systolic and diastolic BP and systemic vascular resistance in normotensive or never-treated hypertensive subjects without comorbidities and cardiovascular medications. Higher plasma calcium concentration potentially plays a role in primary hypertension via an effect on vascular resistance. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The landmark Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Paitients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated that treatment with the sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor empagliflozin rapidly and significantly reduces CVD mortality and admission rates for HF. However, the mechanisms behind this reduction in clinical events are unknown. This study was designed to investigate the effects of the SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin on myocardial perfusion and function in patients with T2D and high CVD risk. Methods and analysis In this investigator-initiated, randomised, double-blind controlled clinical trial, 92 patients with T2D and established CVD or high CVD risk will be randomised to treatment with empagliflozin 25 mg or a matching placebo for 13 weeks. The primary outcome measure is change in myocardial flow reserve measured quantitatively by Rubidium-82 position emission tomography. In a substudy, invasive haemodynamics at rest and during exercise will be measured at baseline and following the intervention, using right heart catheterisation.

Currently, clinical guidelines are mainly concerned to resuscitate septic shock patients from hypotension, hypovolemia, and hypoperfusion; however, if the current resuscitation maneuvers have a beneficial effect also on vascular properties and autonomic functionality is still unclear. The objective of this work is to assess the effects of standard resuscitation at vascular level and to verify if there is any association between alterations in vascular properties and ANS activity. Methods: Six pigs underwent a protocol of polymicrobial septic shock and resuscitation (fluids and noradrenaline). The arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform was recorded in the central aorta and in the peripheral radial and femoral artery. The characteristic arterial time constant was computed at the three arterial sites based on the two-element Windkessel model, to characterize the overall arterial vascular tree. Moreover, independent estimates of total arterial compliance (AC) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were performed. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), low frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) spectral power of diastolic blood pressure, and indices of heart rate variability (HRV) were computed to assess ANS functionality. Results: Septic shock induced a severe vascular disarray, decoupling the usual pressure wave propagation from central to peripheral sites; this phenomenon appeared as an inversion of the physiological pulse pressure (PP) amplification, with a higher PP in the central aorta than in the peripheral arteries. The time constant was decreased, together with AC and TPR. ANS dysfunction was described by a reduced BRS, decreased LF power, and suppressed HRV. This compromised condition was not resolved by administration of fluids and noradrenaline. Thus, a persistent vascular and autonomic dysfunction were reported also in the resuscitated animals, and they were found to be significantly correlated. Conclusion: Measures of vascular function and ANS activity could add information to standard hemodynamic and clinical markers, and the current resuscitation strategies could benefit from the adjunction of these additional functional indices. © Copyright © 2020 Carrara, Herpain, Baselli and Ferrario.","arterial compliance; autonomic cardiovascular regulation; capillary leakage; pulse pressure; sepsis; vascular tone","aerobic glycolysis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; arterial time constant; artery compliance; Article; autonomic nervous system; blood vessel function; blood vessel parameters; blood vessel tone; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; femoral artery; heart rate variability; male; nonhuman; pig; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse pressure; radial artery; regulatory mechanism; resuscitation; septic shock; vascular decoupling; vascular resistance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85088478627"

Materials and methods. The study involved 38 healthy athletesdivers aged 23 to 32 years. Before the session of hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO), the test subject was measured the blood pressure and pulse by the method of oscillometry while he was sitting at rest, after which a fiveminute recording of HRV in sitting position at rest was made. After that, the two test subjects were placed together, sitting with a physician in a pressure (decompression) chamber, where an absolute pressure of 0.25 MPa was created. The test subjects were given 100 % medical oxygen to breathe, their pulse and blood pressure were measured every 15 minutes, and their cardiac output (CO) was calculated by the Starr formula. When there was an increasing tendency of the CO, and also after 75 minutes of oxygen breathing, the test subjects were taken out of the pressure chamber. Immediately after leaving the pressure chamber, the HRV of the test subjects was recorded. According to the results of measurement of hemodynamic parameters, the test subjects were divided into 3 groups.

HRV analysis showed the most significant reliable (p < 0.001) VLF spectrum power (ms2) and relative VLF power (%), as well as Alpha 2 after HBO in the first group of test subjects (unstable) compared to the initial parameters and other groups, which reflects the activation of the sympathetic nervous system and suprasegmental structures of the brain. The essence of changes in the HRV time domain indicators (decrease in SNS index, pNN50 (%), PNS index) confirms the presence of pronounced sympathicotonia in the first group. Conclusions: the three most significant metrics (VLF (ms2), VLF (%) and Alpha 2) were determined with high confidence (p < 0.001), which have a moderate negative correlation (-0.70 < r < -0.30) with the level of divers' resistance to the to the hyperbaric oxygen toxicity. Observations of athletes with high stability showed that they were characterized by changes in hemodynamics of the vagotonic type, while unstable ones were characterized by the sympathicotonic type of regulation. Evaluation of the results showed amoderate correlation between HRV and symptom of oxygen toxicity on divers and is recommended for a reliable (p < 0.05) diagnosis. © 2020 National Electronic-Information Consortium (NEICON)","athletes; divers; heart rate variability (HRV); hyperbaric oxygen toxicity; VLF","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122280126"

Patients and methods: Twenty-one obese adolescents completed a 6-week exercise and dietary program. Body composition and metabolic parameters were measured. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) were used to assess central and systemic arterial stiffness, respectively. Using applanation tonometry, the analyses of central hemodynamic parameters [central blood pressure, heart rate (HR), augmentation index normalized at 75 bpm (AIx75), and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR)] were performed. To determine cardiac autonomic function, heart rate variability (HRV) was analyzed by standard deviation of normal R–R intervals (SDNN), root mean square of successive R–R interval differences (RMSSD), percentage of successive R–R intervals that differed by >50 ms (pNN50), total power (TP), low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) power, and LF/HF ratio. Results: Following the intervention, obese adolescents had reductions in body mass index body fat percentage, brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and HR; and they had shown improvements in lipid profiles. There were reductions in both cfPWV and baPWV following the intervention. Moreover, there were reductions in AIx75, aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressure and an augmentation in SEVR after intervention. The intervention increased cardiac autonomic function (determined by increased SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50HF, and reduced LF/HF). Furthermore, we observed a correlation between increased cardiac autonomic function (SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50 and HF) and increased central hemodynamics, as measured by SEVR and AIx75. Conclusion: Obese adolescents had increased central hemodynamics and autonomic function with reduced arterial stiffness after exercise and dietary restriction. Moreover, a positive correlation between an enhancement of cardiac autonomic function and an augmentation in central hemodynamics was found after the intervention. © 2019 Huang et al.","Adolescents; Arterial stiffness; Cardiac autonomic function; Diet; Exercise; Obesity","lipid; adolescence; adolescent; anthropometry; arterial stiffness; Article; autonomic nerve; body fat; body mass; brachial ankle pulse wave velocity; cardiovascular parameters; carotid femoral pulse wave velocity; child; clinical article; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; exercise; heart function; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamics; human; obesity; pulse wave; RR interval; subendocardial viability ratio; systolic blood pressure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85073804288"

In addition, changes in cardiovascular autonomic regulation have been highlighted as a common factor in the development of cardiometabolic disorders. Objective: To evaluate and compare hemodynamic parameters and cardiovascular autonomic modulation among former tennis players who still play the sport (ET), adults who play recreational tennis (TR), and adults classified as sedentary (S). Methods: Thirty-four men aged between 23 and 45 years participated in the study. They were divided into 3 groups: ET, TR and S. Anthropometric parameters and blood pressure were evaluated and the R-R interval was recorded to quantify the cardiac autonomic modulation at rest. Results: Similar values were observed between groups for blood pressure, waist circumference and body mass index. The amount of moderate and vigorous physical activities of the ET group was higher than that of the TR group. The ET presented resting bradycardia associated with increased pulse interval (PI) variance and high-frequency PI, and a reduction in low-frequency PI compared to the other groups studied. Reduced cardiac sympathovagal balance was observed in the ET group (1.7 ± 0.1) and TR group (2.5 ± 0.2) compared to the S group (3.2 ± 0.2); however, this change was exacerbated in the ET group compared to the TR group. Conclusion: The results suggest that playing tennis induces beneficial changes in cardiac autonomic modulation that appear to be intensified as the volume of physical activity increases, suggesting that this practice is beneficial in the management of cardiovascular risk.

To develop a hardware and software system for external electrical neurostimulation of the baroreceptors of the sino-carotid zone and to investigate body reactions in various modes of electrical stimulation. Materials and methods. The study was performed in 48 healthy volunteers aged 19–21 years. With the help of the developed software and hardware complex, external neurostimulation of the sino-carotid reflexogenic zones was carried out. There were studied 139 reactions to stimulation according to the dynamics of the level of blood pressure, heart rate and heart rate variability. Results and discussion. The hypotensive effect of neurostimulation was revealed after a significant decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and increase of the overall capacity of regulatory mechanisms. With external stimulation, it is preferable to place the electrodes transversely, behind the sternocleidomastoid muscles. The optimal stimulation mode with the pulse repetition frequency of 60–100 Hz and the pulse duration of 1.0 ms was determined. Conclusion. The developed hardware and software system provides the opportunity to perform external electrical neurostimulation of reflexogenic zones. The method is promising for patients of the cardiovascular profile, because it activates the body’s regulatory mechanisms without drugs. © 2019, Professionalnye Izdaniya.

To date, effective reproducible methods are invasive and pose an undesired risk to participants. Previous work in animal models has used infrared thermography to measure the temperature of the lacrimal caruncle region and may be a promising method for measuring stress and pain non-invasively. The current study aimed to determine whether this method is useful in humans. Methods: Sixteen young healthy participants (age: 18–35) were recruited and underwent sympathetic activation using a cold pressor test (CPT) and a muscle chemoreflex (MCR), and completed a control trial. Throughout all trials, infrared thermographic imaging of the lacrimal caruncle, heart rate, heart rate variability, mean arterial blood pressure and pulse transit time were measured. Results: Heart rate (MCR: 4 ± 3 bpm, CPT: 17 ± 4 bpm p < 0.01) and mean arterial pressure increased (MCR: 6 ± 2, CPT: 5 ± 2 mmHg, p < 0.01) and pulse transit time decreased (p = 0.03) with both sympathetic activation interventions. However, lacrimal caruncle temperature did not vary under any condition remaining at 35.2 ± 0.2 °C which was similar to baseline. Conclusions: Our findings suggest infrared thermographic monitoring of eye temperature in humans does not reliably relate to sympathetic activation. This could be due to hemodynamic responses at the lacrimal caruncle that may be more complex than previously proposed with sympathetic activation. Alternatively, pulse transit time seems like a promising non-invasive measure of changes in sympathetic activation in humans. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Infrared imaging; Muscle chemoreflex; Muscle metaboreflex; Sympathetic nervous system activation; Thermography","Adolescent; Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Cold Temperature; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Thermography; Young Adult; adolescent; adult; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; cold; female; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; male; physiology; thermography; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85057727041"

Methods: This case crossover study was conducted on 30 females recruited by convenient sampling. Blood glucose levels were measured in FS and after oral glucose load i.e., HS. Finger arterial blood pressure (BP) and ECG were recorded constantly to monitor baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV). Autonomic reactivity was tested with deep breathing (DB), Valsalva manoeuvre (VM), and head-up-tilt (HUT) test under FS and HS. HRV parameters not normally distributed were natural log (ln) transformed. Results: Significantly reduced Valsalva ratio and higher heart rate and BP were observed in HS that continued during HUT (P < 0.05). The lnSDNN (standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals) and lnRMSSD (root mean square of successive differences) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) in HS during HUT. After HUT, lnRMSSD remained lower (P = 0.031), whereas lnLF/HF (low frequency/high frequency power) ratio (P = 0.042) and LFnu (normalized units) (P = 0.024) were higher in HS. BRS was significantly lower in supine position in HS compared to FS and further reduced in HUT position in both FS and HS (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Compared to FS, the HS exhibited heightened sympathetic activity with attenuation of parasympathetic activity and this phenomenon was further accentuated by HUT. BRS was more sensitive indicator of autonomic effects of hyperglycemia in resting state. In addition to standard tests, autonomic reactivity in vulnerable young subjects could be useful to detect autonomic imbalance at an early stage. © 2020 Diabetes India","Autonomic activity; Autonomic reactivity; Baroreceptor sensitivity; Fasting; Heart rate variability; Hyperglycaemia; Orthostatic challenge","Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular System; Cross-Over Studies; Fasting; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Rate; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Pressoreceptors; Prognosis; Young Adult; glucose; biological marker; adult; arterial pressure; Article; body mass; crossover procedure; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiogram; fasting; female; glucose blood level; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; hyperglycemia; hyperpnea; mean arterial pressure; oral glucose tolerance test; pressoreceptor; priority journal; pulse pressure; supine position; Valsalva maneuver; young adult; autonomic nervous system; baroreceptor; blood pressure; cardiovascular system; comparative study; diet restriction; follow up; heart rate; hyperglycemia; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; prognosis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089178572"

The present study investigated the long-term prognostic significance of the short-term blood pressure variability in patients on hemodialysis. A total of 149 patients (53.0% male; mean age: 54.5±15.1 years) receiving regular hemodialysis for >6 months were enrolled. They completed a 44-hour (excluding the hemodialysis session) ambulatory BP monitoring and comprehensive hemodynamic assessments, including carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and pressure waveform decomposition (forward and backward wave amplitude). Blood pressure variability parameters, including average real variability (ARV) of systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse pressure (ARVp) during daytime, nighttime, and overall 44 hours were calculated. During a median follow-up of 14 years, 78 deaths (52.4%) were confirmed. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, none of the ambulatory BP parameters were predictive of mortality. In contrast, nighttime ARVp was consistently and significantly associated with all-cause mortality in multivariable Cox models adjusting for age, sex, albumin, hemodialysis treatment adequacy, and 44-hour systolic BP (continuous variable analysis, per 1-SD, hazard ratio=1.348; 95% CI, 1.029-1.767; categorical variable analysis, ≥8.5 versus <8.5 mm Hg; hazard ratio=1.825; 95% CI, 1.074-3.103). Forward wave amplitude and 44-hour systolic BP were identified as the 2 most important determinants of nighttime ARVp. Addition of nighttime ARVp to the base model significantly improved prediction of all-cause mortality (Net reclassification improvement =0.198; P=0.0012). In hemodialysis patients, increased short-term nighttime pulse pressure variability but not ambulatory BP levels were significantly predictive of long-term all-cause mortality. © 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Insufficient understanding of the integrative function or dysfunction of these physiological systems has led to many examples of unexpected or incompletely understood clinical trial results. Mathematical models of heart and kidney physiology have long been used to better understand the function of these organs, but an integrated model of renal function and cardiac function and cardiac remodeling has not yet been published. Here we describe an integrated cardiorenal model that couples existing cardiac and renal models, and expands them to simulate cardiac remodeling in response to pressure and volume overload, as well as hypertrophy regression in response to angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The model is able to reproduce different patterns of hypertrophy in response to pressure and volume overload. We show that increases in myocyte diameter are adaptive in pressure overload not only because it normalizes wall shear stress, as others have shown before, but also because it limits excess volume accumulation and further elevation of cardiac stresses by maintaining cardiac output and renal sodium and water balance. The model also reproduces the clinically observed larger LV mass reduction with angiotensin receptor blockers than with beta blockers. We further provide a mechanistic explanation for this difference by showing that heart rate lowering with beta blockers limits the reduction in peak systolic wall stress (a key signal for myocyte hypertrophy) relative to ARBs. © Copyright © 2021 Hallow, Van Brackle, Anjum and Ermakov.","angiotensin receptor antagonist; cardiac remodeling; cardiorenal; hypertrophy (left ventricular); pressure overload; renal; systems pharmacology; volume overload","angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive therapy; Article; blood flow velocity; blood pressure; diastolic blood pressure; disease simulation; enzyme active site; finite element analysis; fluid balance; fluid retention; glomerulus filtration rate; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle oxygen consumption; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart stress; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle function; heart ventricle remodeling; hemodynamics; human; hydrostatic pressure; hyperpolarization; hypertension; hypertrophy; kidney function; kidney perfusion; mathematical model; mean arterial pressure; muscle hypertrophy; pulse wave; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; shear stress; simulation; sodium balance; sodium urine level; steady state; systolic blood pressure","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85108996704"

Methods A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted on the postoperative hypovolemic patients admitted to Department of Intensive Care Unit of Fujian Provincial Hospital from August 2018 to August 2020. They were randomly divided into PPV group and central venous pressure（CVP） group, and fluid resuscitation targeted by PPV <10%（measured by CNAP） and CVP 8～12 mmHg were performed respectively. The main outcomes included fluid resuscitation time, duration of mechanical ventilation, cumulative fluid balance and incidence of cardiopulmonary complications. The secondary outcomes included hemodynamics [heart rate（HR）, mean arterial pressure（MAP）, CVP, cardiac index（CI）, and PPV] and tissue oxygen metabolism [central venous oxygen saturation（ScvO2）, arterial lactic acid（Lac）, oxygen delivery index（DO2I）, oxygen consumption index（VO2I）, and oxygen uptake rate（ERO2）] as the goal of fluid resuscitation was arrived. Results A total of 78 patients were enrolled, including 38 in PPV group and 40 in CVP group. There were no significant differences in the baseline, hemodynamic and tissue oxygen metabolism parameters between the 2 groups（all P>0.05）. The hemodynamic and tissue oxygen metabolism parameters were significantly improved as the goal of fluid resuscitation was arrived. No significant differences were seen in MAP, CI and PPV between the 2 groups after fluid resuscitation（all P>0.05）, while CVP in the PPV group was significantly lower than that of the CVP group（P<0.05）. Compared with the CVP group, the ScvO2, DO2I, VO2I and ERO2 were increased significantly after fluid resuscitation in the PPV group（all P<0.05）, while Lac was decreased obviously in the PPV group（P<0.05）. Furthermore, the fluid resuscitation time and duration of mechanical ventilation were notably shortened, the cumulative fluid balance was remarkably decreased, and the incidence of cardiopulmonary complications was statistically reduced in the PPV group than the CVP group（all P<0.05）. Conclusion PPV measured by CNAP monitor can be used to guide the early fluid resuscitation in postoperative hypovolemic patients, which contributes to stabilizing the hemodynamic state more timely, improving the tissue oxygen metabolism, shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation, and reducing the risk of cardiopulmonary complications. © Journal of Army Medical University 2022.","continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitor; fluid resuscitation; postoperation; pulse pressure variability","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131234841"

The usefulness of this approach still needs to be clarified in low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery. Both pulse-pressure variation (PPV) and pleth variability index (PVI) can be used to guide GDFT strategies. The objective of this prospective randomized controlled trial was to determine if the use of PVI guided GDFT, when compared to PPV guided GDFT, would lead to similar hospital LOS in patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk surgery. Secondary outcomes included amount of fluid administered and incidence of postoperative complications. Methods: Patients were randomized into either PVI or PPV guided GDFT groups. Both received a baseline 2 ml kg- 1 h- 1 Lactated Ringer infusion. Additional fluid boluses consisted of 250 mL of colloid that was infused over a 10 min period if PVI was > 15% or PPV was > 13% for at least five minutes. The primary outcome was to determine if hospital LOS, which was defined as the number of days from surgery up to the day the surgeon authorized hospital discharge, was equivalent between the two groups. Results: A total of 76 patients were included and they were randomized into two groups of 38 patients. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Both PVI and PPV guided GDFT strategies were equivalent for the primary outcome of LOS (median [interquartile range]) (days) 2.5 [2.0-3.3] vs. 3.0 [2.0-5.0], p = 0.230, respectively. Fluids infused, postoperative complications, and all other outcomes were not different between groups. Conclusion: In patients undergoing low-to-moderate risk abdominal surgery, PVI seems to guide GDFT similarly to PPV in regards to hospital LOS, amount of fluid, and incidence of postoperative complications. However, in low-risk patients undergoing these surgical procedures optimizing stroke volume may have limited impact on outcome.

Blood pressure (BP) determination in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients remains challenging due to its high inter-measurement variability. The novel methodology of precise beat-to-beat BP determination may be used to guide the hypotensive therapy selection and adjustment, but along with that provides additional opportunity for the investigation of hemodynamics in patients with chronic AF. Material and method. The study sample consisted of 60 patients with the main diagnosis of grade II-III arterial hypertension; 30 of those were on sinus rhythm and 30 had chronic non-valvular AF. In all patients HR was within the limits recommended for left ventricular ejection fraction of >40%. Beat-to-beat systolic, diastolic, and pulse BP (SBP, DBP, and PBP, respectively) assessment at each heart beat within 15 minute interval was performed with “Kardiotekhnika-SAKR” system (NAO “Incart”, St.Petersburg, Russia). Results. Mild RR-interval variations, observed on sinus rhythm, resulted in insignificant SBP, DBP, and PBP fluctuations. More prominent RR-interval irregularity, typical for AF, is accompanied by more significant SBP, DBP, and PBP deviations. As mean SBP of each patient was taken for 1,0, “normal” SBP (≥0,9) was seen in RR-intervals of 754±58 msec; “markedly decreased” (<0,9)-in 619±66 msec; “prominently decreased” (<0,8)-in 527±86 msec; “severely decreased” (<0,7)-in 489±38 msec. For DBP (mean DBP of each patient was taken for 1,0) “normal” DBP (<1,1) was seen in RR-intervals of 758±63 msec; “markedly increased” (>1,15)-in 587±38 msec; “prominently increased” (>1,2)-in 566±38 msec; “severely increased” (>1,2)-in 539±41 msec. For PBP (mean PBP of each patient was taken for 1,0) “normal” PBP (≥0,75) was seen in RR-intervals of 770±58 msec; “markedly decreased” (<0,75)-in 561±40 msec; “prominently decreased” (<0,5)-in 520±33 msec; “severely decreased” (<0,25)-in 510±52 msec. Proportion of heart beats with insufficient efficacy according to PBP level (sum of “markedly”, “prominently”, and “severely” decreased) was 16,4±5,1% with prominent individual deviations (5,9-25,7%). Mean range of RR-interval providing to “marked” PBP decrease was 147±26 msec, also with significant individual variations-55-235 msec. Conclusions. Beat to beat BP measurement is characterized by high level of accuracy. In addition to mean SBP and DBP, their beat-to-beat fluctuations can be determined, which might be significant in irregular rhythm. This might help in selection of individualized anti-hypertensive therapy. The study has shown that along with RR-intervals shortening the number of hemodynamically insufficient heart beats increased, which manifested by SBP decrease, DBP increase, resulting in decrease of PBP. However, this general consistent pattern masks the individual differences of heart rhythm structure in AF. This method can help to determine the optimal HR for each individual patient with AF. © 2021, NJSC Institute of Cardiological Technology (INCART).

A greater understanding of its impact on multiple organ systems is essential in reducing the burden of disease. In this review we will summarize previously reported cardiovascular parameters of both adults and children with severe malaria. Method: For this systematic review we searched MEDLINE and PUBMED for all papers published on cardiac function in severe malaria from January 1, 1990 until September 1, 2019. Severe malaria was defined as per World Health Organization. Publications were included if there was data from echocardiography, Pulse Contour Cardiac Output (PiCCO), or Pulmonary Arterial catheters (PAC) reported. Studies were excluded if related to medication induced cardiac dysfunction, malaria in pregnancy, or included subjects with known pre-existing heart disease. Results: Twenty-four studies met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were studies of adult patients or a mixed cohort. Six solely involved pediatric patients. Significant heterogeneity existed in the cardiac parameters measured and results reported. One pediatric and one adult study suggested a reduced preload state during severe malaria. Cardiac systolic function was reported primarily within, or above, normative numeric ranges established in uninfected pediatric patients without anemia. Extensive variability existed in adult studies with reports of an elevated cardiac index in two studies, normal cardiac function in two studies, and descriptions of decreased function in two studies. Two reports suggest afterload in pediatric severe malaria is reduced. Reports of changes in the systemic vascular resistance of adults with severe malaria are inconsistent, with two trials demonstrating an increase and two suggesting a decrease. Studies demonstrated a mild rise in pulmonary pressure in both pediatric and adult patients that normalized by discharge. Conclusion: Based on limited data, the cardiovascular effects of severe malaria appear to be heterogeneous and vary depending on age. Further detailed studies are required to explore and understand the overall hemodynamic effects of this high burden disease.

We investigated the effect of passive head-up tilt on aortic blood pressure.Methods:Noninvasive peripheral and central hemodynamics in 613 volunteers without cardiovascular morbidities or medications were examined using pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography and heart rate variability analysis.Results:In all participants, mean aortic SBP decreased by -4 (-5 to -3) mmHg [mean (95% confidence intervals)] and DBP increased by 6 (5 - 6) mmHg in response to upright posture. When divided into tertiles according to the supine-to-upright change in aortic SBP, two tertiles presented with a decrease [-15 (-14 to -16) and -4 (-3 to -4) mmHg, respectively] whereas one tertile presented with an increase [+7 (7 - 8) mmHg] in aortic SBP. There were no major differences in demographic characteristics between the tertiles. In regression analysis, the strongest explanatory factors for upright changes in aortic SBP were the supine values of, and upright changes in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, and supine aortic SBP.Conclusion:In participants without cardiovascular disease, the changes in central SBP during orthostatic challenge are not uniform. One-third presented with higher upright than supine aortic SBP with underlying differences in the regulation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. These findings emphasize that resting blood pressure measurements give only limited information about the blood pressure status. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Method: We compared the capabilities of a single hidden layer neural network of 12 nodes to those of a discrete-feature discrimination approach with the goal being to predict the likelihood of a given patient developing significant hypotension under spinal anesthesia when undergoing a Cesarean section (C/S). Physiological input information was derived from a non-invasive blood pressure device (Caretaker [CT]) that utilizes a finger cuff to measure blood pressure and other hemodynamic parameters via pulse contour analysis. Receiver-operator-curve/area-under-curve analyses were used to compare performance. Results: The results presented here suggest that a neural network approach (Area Under Curve [AUC] = 0.89 [p < 0.001]), at least at the implementation level of a clinically relevant prediction algorithm, may be superior to a discrete feature quantification approach (AUC = 0.87 [p < 0.001]), providing implicit access to a plurality of features and combinations thereof. In addition, the expansion of the approach to include the submission of other physiological data signals, such as heart rate variability, to the network can be readily envisioned. Conclusion: This pilot study has demonstrated that increased coherence in Arterial Stiffness (AS) variability obtained from the pulse wave analysis of a continuous non-invasive blood pressure device appears to be an effective predictor of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in the obstetrics population undergoing C/S. This allowed us to predict specific dosing thresholds of phenylephrine required to maintain systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg. © 2020 The Author(s).","Arterial stiffness; Cesarean section; Finger cuff; Hypotension; Neural network; Non-invasive; Predictive algorithm","Adult; Anesthesia, Obstetrical; Anesthesia, Spinal; Blood Pressure; Cesarean Section; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypotension; Neural Networks, Computer; Phenylephrine; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Young Adult; bupivacaine; hypertensive factor; phenylephrine; phenylephrine; vasoconstrictor agent; adult; algorithm; analytic method; arterial stiffness; Article; cesarean section; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; data processing; diagnostic test accuracy study; discrete feature quantification approach; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; elective surgery; female; gold standard; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; hypotension; low drug dose; non invasive procedure; obstetric patient; physiological process; pilot study; prediction; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; pulse wave; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; single hidden layer feedforward neural network; spinal anesthesia; adverse event; blood pressure; cesarean section; dose response; drug effect; heart rate; hypotension; obstetric anesthesia; pregnancy; procedures; spinal anesthesia; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084422153"

Long-term pre-dialysis blood pressure variability (BPV) in haemodialysis patients is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The association of the main haemodynamic culprit in dialysis, that is, short-term BPV, with outcomes has not been investigated. We examine the prognostic role of short-term BPV for mortality and cardiovascular events in this population. Methods. A total of 227 haemodialysis patients underwent 44-h ambulatory monitoring during a standard interval and were followed-up for 30.17 ± 17.70 months. We calculated SD, weighted SD (wSD), coefficient of variation (CV) and average real variability (ARV) of BP with validated formulas. The primary endpoint was first occurrence of all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. Secondary endpoints were: (i) all-cause mortality, (ii) cardiovascular mortality and (iii) a combination of cardiovascular events. Results. Cumulative freedom from the primary endpoint was similar for quartiles of pre-dialysis and 44-h systolic BP (SBP), but was progressively longer for increasing quartiles of 44-h SBP-SD (P = 0.014), wSD (P = 0.007), CV (P = 0.031) and ARV (83.9, 71.9, 70.2 and 43.9% for quartiles 1-4; P < 0.001). Higher quartiles of 44-h SBP-ARV were associated with higher risk of all studied outcomes. Among diastolic BPV indices, 44-h diastolic BP (DBP)-CV and 44-h DBP-ARV were associated with increased risk for the composite cardiovascular outcome. In Cox regression analysis, SBP-BPV was related to the primary endpoint, independently of SBP levels and interdialytic weight gain [ARV: hazard ratio (HR) 1.115, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.048-1.185]. This association become insignificant after adjustment for pulse wave velocity (PWV; HR 1.061, 95% CI 0.989-1.137), and further attenuated after additional adjustment for age, dialysis vintage, gender, comorbidities and prevalent cardiovascular disease (HR 1.031, 95% CI 0.946-1.122). Conclusions. Increased BPV during the interdialytic interval is associated with higher risk of death and cardiovascular events, whereas ambulatory BP levels are not.

However, its positive effects on college students remain poorly understood. This study aimed to systematically investigate the potential efficiency of the Baduanjin exercise on the maintenance of the homeostasis of body composition and the improvement of the cardiovascular function of the college students. The study revealed a promising efficacy of the Baduanjin exercise in the prevention of the loss of water, inorganic salts, protein, and muscle contents and the accumulation of body fat. Furthermore, the present study also demonstrated the positive efficacy of Baduanjin exercise in decreasing of peripheral and central arterial blood pressure and carotid and femoral artery pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) of the college students. Moreover, the heart rate variability (HRV) analysis was also performed using the assessment of time and frequency domain indices. The data showed that all of the time-domain indices and the high-frequency (HF) band of the HRV relatively increased, whereas the low-frequency (LF) band of the HRV relatively decreased after the long-term Baduanjin exercise. Collectively, the present study suggested that a 12-week Baduanjin exercise could maintain the body composition in a relatively healthy and stable range and improve blood pressure, central hemodynamics, and the arterial stiffness of the college students. The underlying mechanism might be due to the improvement of parasympathetic activity and the suppression of sympathetic activity of college students via Baduanjin exercise. © 2021","Autonomic nervous regulation; Body composition; Cardiovascular function; Mind-body practice","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116659890"

Owing to the hidden physiological and pathological information present in BP time-series, increasing interest has been given to the study of continuous, beat-to-beat BP variability (BPV) using invasive and noninvasive methods. Different linear and nonlinear parameters of variability are employed in the characterization of BP signals in health and disease. Although linear parameters of beat-to-beat BPV are mainly measures of dispersion, such as standard deviation (SD), nonlinear parameters of BPV quantify the degree of complexity/irregularity-using measures of entropy or self-similarity/correlation. In this review, we summarize the value of linear and nonlinear parameters in reflecting different information about the pathophysiology of changes in beat-to-beat BPV independent of or superior to mean BP. We then provide a comparison of the relative power of linear and nonlinear parameters of beat-to-beat BPV in detecting early and subtle differences in various states. The practical advantage and utility of beat-to-beat BPV monitoring support its incorporation into routine clinical practices. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients that underwent elective surgery. Invasive arterial pressure, electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, heart rate and bispectral index were monitored. PWTT and BPV were measured with special software. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol, sufentanil and rocuronium. Results: A total of 54 patients were included in this study. There was no correlation between BPV and the dose of propofol, sufentanil and rocuronium during anaesthesia induction. Bivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that PWTT (r = –0.54), age (r = 0.34) and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.31) significantly correlated with systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV). Only PWTT (r = –0.38) was significantly correlated with diastolic blood pressure variability (DBPV). Patients were stratified into high PWTT and low PWTT groups according to the mean PWTT value (96.8 ± 17.2 ms). Compared with the high PWTT group, the SBPV of the low PWTT group increased significantly by 3.4%. The DBPV of the low PWTT group increased significantly by 2.1% compared with the high PWTT group. Conclusions: PWTT, assessed before anaesthesia induction, may be an effective predictor of haemodynamic fluctuations during anaesthesia induction. © The Author(s) 2021.","anaesthesia induction; blood pressure variation; Pulse wave transit time","Anesthesia, General; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Humans; Prospective Studies; Pulse Wave Analysis; propofol; rocuronium; sufentanil; adult; aged; anesthesia induction; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; Article; atherosclerosis; bispectral index; blood pressure variability; cohort analysis; controlled study; correlational study; coughing; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure variability; difficult intubation; disease association; drug dose titration; elective surgery; electrocardiography; female; heart rate; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; observational study; prediction; predictor variable; prospective study; pulse oximetry; pulse wave; pulse wave transit time; single drug dose; systolic blood pressure; systolic blood pressure variability; blood pressure; blood pressure monitoring; general anesthesia","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120493912"

Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) is a bidirectional forward and backward motion of the arterial wall; however, there is no evidence in humans for what controls CALM despite proposals for pulse pressure, left ventricular motion and shear rate. What is the main finding and its importance? Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion responses were heterogeneous when manipulating sympathetic activation and endothelium-independent vasodilatation, leading to non-significant group responses. However, individual CALM responses were associated with left ventricular rotation and shear rate. These findings are important when interpreting changes in CALM in humans with acute or chronic experimental designs. Carotid artery longitudinal wall motion (CALM) has recently attracted interest as an indicator of arterial health; however, the regulation of CALM is poorly understood. We conducted a series of studies aimed at manipulating pulse pressure (PP), left ventricular (LV) motion and carotid shear rate, which have been previously suggested to regulate various components of CALM pattern and magnitude. To determine the regulatory influences on CALM, 15 healthy men (22 ± 2 years old) were exposed to three acute interventions: the serial subtraction test (SST); the cold pressor test (CPT); and exposure to sublingual nitroglycerine (NTG). The SST elicited increases in PP (P < 0.01), apical LV rotation (P < 0.01) and carotid shear rate (P < 0.01), with no changes in CALM (P > 0.05). Likewise, the CPT elicited increases in PP (P = 0.01), basal LV rotation (P = 0.04) and carotid shear rate (P = 0.01), with no changes in CALM (P > 0.05). Conversely, exposure to NTG elicited no change in PP (P = 0.22), basal (P = 0.65) or apical LV rotation (P = 0.45), but did decrease carotid shear rate (P < 0.01), without altering CALM (P > 0.05). Considerable individual variability in CALM responses prompted further analyses where all three interventions were pooled for change scores. Changes in LV basal rotation were related to changes in systolic retrograde CALM (B = −0.025, P = 0.03), whereas changes in carotid shear rate were related to changes in diastolic CALM displacement (B = 0.0009, P = 0.01). The interventions were underpinned by relationships between CALM and both LV basal rotation and local shear rate at the individual level, indicating that cardiac and haemodynamic factors may influence CALM in humans. © 2017 The Authors.

The glove incorporates local heating and cooling of the hand using multi-point skin temperature measurements as feedback, and thereby induces local and central mechanisms involved in thermoregulation. Electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG) and non-invasive finger-cuff based blood pressure (BP) measurements were used to monitor electrophysiology and hemodynamic changes in response to temperature modulation. Then, the triggered neuro-vascular mechanisms associated with thermoregulation were quantified by extracting parameters from the measured waveforms, specifically heart rate variability (HRV), vascular tone, and BP. The system was tested on six young, healthy individuals with no history of microvascular diseases. During heating, vasodilation, decrease in systolic BP, and a decrease in parasympathetic tone were observed, while during cooling, vasoconstriction and increased BP were observed. While such changes are expected physiologically using passive experiments, the ability to modulate the physiology non-invasively with a controlled, quantitative, and inexpensive instrument can potentially enable serial assessments of neuro-vascular control outside of clinical settings. © 2016 IEEE.","","Blood Pressure; Heart Rate; Humans; Pulse Wave Analysis; Skin Temperature; Temperature; Vasoconstriction; blood pressure; heart rate; human; physiology; pulse wave; skin temperature; temperature; vasoconstriction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009110329"

Its function is assessed by baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) - a parameter which quantifies the relationship between changes in ABP and corresponding changes in heart rate (HR). The effect of postural change as well as the effect of changes in blood O2 and CO2 have been the focus of multiple previous studies on BRS. However, little is known about the influence of the combination of these two factors on dynamic baroreflex response. Furthermore, classical methods used for BRS assessment are based on the assumption of stationarity that may lead to unreliable results in the case of mostly nonstationary cardiovascular signals. Therefore, we aimed to investigate BRS during repeated transitions between squatting and standing in normal end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) conditions (normocapnia) and conditions of progressively increasing EtCO2 with a decreasing level of O2 (hypercapnia with hypoxia) using joint time and frequency domain (TF) approach to BRS estimation that overcomes the limitation of classical methods. Noninvasive continuous measurements of ABP and EtCO2 were conducted in a group of 40 healthy young volunteers. The time course of BRS was estimated from TF representations of pulse interval variability and systolic pressure variability, their coherence, and phase spectra. The relationship between time-variant BRS and indices of ABP and HR was analyzed during postural change in normocapnia and hypercapnia with hypoxia. In normocapnia, observed trends in all measures were in accordance with previous studies, supporting the validity of presented TF method. Similar but slightly attenuated response to postural change was observed in hypercapnia with hypoxia. Our results show the merits of the nonstationary methods as a tool to study the cardiovascular system during short-term hemodynamic changes. © 2019 Agnieszka Kazimierska et al.","","Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Arterial Pressure; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypercapnia; Hypocapnia; Hypoxia; Male; Oxygen; Posture; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Systole; Young Adult; Blood; Blood pressure; Carbon dioxide; Feedback; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; carbon dioxide; oxygen; Arterial blood pressure; Baroreflex sensitivities; Cardiovascular signals; Continuous measurements; Hemodynamic changes; Negative feedback loop; Time and frequency domains; Time frequency analysis; adult; arterial pressure; Article; body position; breathing rate; chemoreceptor reflex; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; frequency analysis; hemodynamics; human; hypercapnia; male; normal human; orthostatic stress; physical parameters; plethysmography; pressoreceptor reflex; sensitivity analysis; sitting; time frequency analysis; adolescent; algorithm; blood pressure; chemistry; heart rate; hypercapnia; hypocapnia; hypoxia; pathophysiology; signal processing; systole; young adult; Frequency estimation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85062370046"

The pleth variability index (PVI) has been shown to be a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness of perioperative and critically ill patients; however, it has not been evaluated in OLT. This study was designed to examine whether the PVI can reliably predict fluid responsiveness in OLT and to compare PVI with other hemodynamic indexes that are measured using the PiCCO2 monitoring system. Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this study. Each patient was monitored using the noninvasive Masimo and PiCCO2 monitoring system. PVI was obtained with a Masimo pulse oximeter. Cardiac index was obtained using a transpulmonary thermodilution technique (CITPTD). Stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation, and systemic vascular resistance index were measured using the PiCCO2 system. Fluid loading (10 mL/kg colloid) was performed at two different phases during the operation, and fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in CITPTD ≥ 15%. During the dissection phase and the anhepatic phase, respectively, 14 patients (56%) and 18 patients (75%) were classified as responders. There were no differences between the baseline values of the PVI of responders and nonresponders. Area under the curve for PVI was 0.56 (sensitivity 35%, specificity 90%, p = 0.58) at dissection phase, and was 0.55 (sensitivity 55%, specificity 66%, p = 0.58) at anhepatic phase. Of the parameters, a higher area under the curve value was found for SVV. We conclude that PVI was unable to predict fluid responsiveness with sufficient accuracy in patients undergoing OLT, but the SVV parameter was reliable. © 2016","Fluid responsiveness; Liver transplantation; Pleth variability index","Blood Pressure; Demography; Female; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Plethysmography; ROC Curve; Stroke Volume; dopamine; fresh frozen plasma; human albumin; noradrenalin; adult; Article; clinical article; female; fiberoptic oximeter catheter; fluid therapy; heart index; heart stroke volume; human; liver failure; liver transplantation; male; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; parameters; pleth variability index; pulse oximeter; pulse pressure; sensitivity and specificity; systemic vascular resistance; thermodilution; blood pressure; demography; evaluation study; hemodynamics; middle aged; plethysmography; receiver operating characteristic","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84977470376"

Patients and methods We carried out a prospective observational study using data from 73 general anesthesia hepatobiliary postoperative adult patients admitted to an ICU over a 1-year period. A standard procedure was used for the arm elevation test. The value of invasive radial arterial pressure was recorded at baseline, and 30 and 60 s after the arm had been raised from 0° to 90°. We compared the blood pressure before versus after arm elevation, and between hemodynamically stable, hypovolemic shock, and septic shock patient groups. Results In all 73 patients, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) decreased, diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) increased, and pulse pressure (PP) decreased at 30 and 60 s after arm elevation (P<0.01), but the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was unchanged (P>0.05). On comparing 30 and 60 s, there was no significant difference in SAP, DAP, PP, or MAP (P>0.05). In 40 hemodynamically stable patients, SAP and PP decreased, and DAP and MAP increased significantly at 30 and 60 s after arm elevation compared with baseline (P<0.01). In 16 hypovolemic patients, SAP, DAP, and MAP increased significantly compared with baseline at 30 and 60 s (P<0.01), but PP was unchanged (P>0.05). In 17 patients with septic shock, SAP, PP, and MAP decreased significantly versus baseline at 30 and 60 s (P<0.01), but DAP was unchanged (P>0.05). Comparison of the absolute value of pressure change of septic shock patients at 30 s after raising the arm showed that SAP, DAP, and MAP changes were significantly lower compared with those in hypovolemic shock and hemodynamically stable patients (P<0.01). The areas under the receiver operator characteristic curve for predicting septic shock was 0.930 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.867-0.992, P< 0.001] for change value at 30 s after arm elevation of SAP. The best cut-off point for the SAP change value was -5 mmHg or less, with a sensitivity of 94.12%, a specificity of 80.36%, a positive likelihood ratio of 4.79 (95% CI: 2.8-8.2), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.073 (95% CI: 0.01-0.5). Conclusion Our study shows that hypovolemic shock and septic shock patients have significantly different radial artery invasive blood pressure changes in an arm elevation test, which could be applied as a new method to distinguish hypovolemic shock and septic shock from hypotension. © Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Invasive methods are not suitable for routine clinic or research use, and noninvasive methods such as impedance cardiography have technical and practical limitations. Fingertip pulse contour analysis using the Nexfin device is a novel alternative to noninvasive assessment of blood pressure and hemodynamics. Although both impedance cardiography and the Nexfin have been validated against invasive methods, the extent to which they are correlated with each other is unknown. This study is a comparative analysis of data simultaneously obtained by impedance cardiography and using the Nexfin device. Methods As part of a larger clinical trial, 13 adults with type 2 diabetes completed cardiovascular reactivity testing on three occasions: at study baseline and after two 4-week dietary treatment periods. Blood pressure, hemodynamics, and heart rate variability were assessed at rest and during acute mental stress. Results Blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability data were significantly correlated between the two devices, but hemodynamic data (stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance) were not significantly correlated. Both techniques detected treatment-related changes in blood pressure and total peripheral resistance, but significantly differed in the magnitude and/or direction of treatment effects. Conclusion We conclude that Nexfin is not an appropriate alternative to impedance cardiography for measurement of underlying hemodynamics in psychophysiological research, but may be useful for beat-to-beat monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate variability. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","blood pressure; heart rate variability; impedance cardiography; pulse contour analysis; systemic hemodynamics","Adult; Animals; Blood Pressure; Cardiography, Impedance; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fingers; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse; Vascular Resistance; adult; aged; analysis; Article; blood pressure monitoring; cardiovascular response; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; diet therapy; female; fingertip pulse contour analysis; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic monitoring; human; impedance cardiograph; impedance cardiography; intermethod comparison; male; mental stress; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; non invasive blood pressure monitor; non invasive procedure; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rest; vascular resistance; animal; blood pressure; clinical trial; comparative study; crossover procedure; finger; heart rate; impedance cardiography; middle aged; pathophysiology; pulse rate; vascular resistance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84937779473"

The aims of this study were to generate a panel of RNO3 congenic sub-strains to genetically dissect the implicated loci and identify positional candidate genes by microarray expression profiling and analysis of next-generation sequencing data. Method and results: A panel of congenic sub-strains were generated containing Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)-introgressed segments of varying size on the SHRSP genetic background, focused within the first 50 Mbp of RNO3. Haemodynamic profiling during salt challenge demonstrated significantly reduced systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and PP variability in SP.WKYGla3a, SP.WKYGla3c, SP.WKYGla3d and SP.WKYGla3e substrains. Only SBP and DBP were significantly reduced during salt challenge in SP.WKYGla3b and SP.WKYGla3f sub-strains, whereas SP.WKYGla3g rats did not differ in haemodynamic response to SHRSP. Those sub-strains demonstrating significantly reduced PP variability during salt challenge also demonstrated significantly reduced renal pathology and proteinuria. Microarray expression profiling prioritized two candidate genes for blood pressure regulation (Dnm1, Tor1b), localized within the common congenic interval shared by SP.WKYGla3d and SP.WKYGla3f strains, and one candidate gene for saltinduced PP variability and renal pathology (Rabgap1), located within the region unique to the SP.WKYGla3d strain. Comparison of next-generation sequencing data identified variants within additional positional genes that are likely to affect protein function. Conclusion: This study has identified distinct intervals on RNO3-containing genes that may be important for blood pressure regulation and renal pathology during salt challenge. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The aim of the present study was to determine if blood-pressure-waveform (BPW) harmonic indexes can be used to discriminate hemodynamic differences between healthy control subjects and patients with breast cancer. Methods Ten-minute bilateral radial BPW signals were obtained noninvasively in 23 breast-cancer patients and 23 healthy subjects. The amplitude proportion (C n), phase angle (Pn), and harmonic variability (CV n) were calculated for harmonics 1 to 10 of the BPW. Results C 1, C 2, and P 1 were significantly smaller and P7, P9, CV2, and CV3 were significantly larger in the control group than in the cancer group. Conclusion The differences identified between the breast-cancer and control groups illustrate significant hemodynamic changes induced by breast cancer at stages 0-2. The BPW harmonic indexes investigated in this study may be useful for detecting these hemodynamic changes and thus improving the sensitivity of discriminating between healthy controls and patients with early-stage breast cancer.

Management with static preload indicators, such as central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, has not demonstrated a suitable relationship with changes in the cardiac output induced by intravenous fluid therapy. Dynamic indicators, such as the variability of arterial pulse pressure or stroke volume variation, have demonstrated a suitable relationship. Since improvement in cardiac output does not guarantee an adequate perfusion pressure, in patients with hypotension, it is also necessary to know whether arterial pressure will also increase with intravenous fluid therapy. In this regard, the functional assessment of arterial load by dynamic arterial elastance could help to determine which patients will improve not only their cardiac output but also their mean arterial pressure. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","cardiac output; critical care; fluid therapy; hemodynamic monitoring; pulse pressure","Cardiac Output; Cardiovascular Diseases; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Predictive Value of Tests; Resuscitation; Stroke Volume; central venous pressure; functional assessment; heart output; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic monitoring; human; intravenous drug administration; mean arterial pressure; perfusion pressure; plethysmography; positive end expiratory pressure; predictive value; priority journal; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; pulse pressure; Review; sensitivity and specificity; systolic blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; critical illness; fluid therapy; hemodynamics; intensive care; pathophysiology; physiology; resuscitation","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041332904"

The classic paradigm attributes a predominant role to increased pulse wave velocity (PWV) and premature wave reflections (WRs). A controversial new paradigm proposes increased forward pressure wave amplitude (FWA), attributed to proximal aortic characteristic impedance (Zc), as the predominant factor, with minor contributions from WRs. Based on theoretical considerations, we hypothesized that (rectified) WRs drive the increase in FWA, and that the forward pressure wave does not depend solely on the interaction between flow and Zc (QZc product). Methods and Results-We performed 3 substudies: (1) open-chest anesthetized dog experiments (n = 5); (2) asymmetric T-tube model-based study; and (3) human study in a diverse clinical population (n = 193). Animal experiments demonstrated that FWA corresponds to peak QZC only when WRs are minimal. As WRs increased, FWA was systematically greater than QZc and peaked well after peak flow, analogous to late-systolic peaking of pressure attributable to WRs. T-tube modeling confirmed that increased/ premature WRs resulted in increased FWA. Magnitude and timing of WRs explained 80.8% and 74.3% of the variability in the difference between FWA and peak QZc in dog and human substudies, respectively. Conclusions-Only in cases of minimal reflections does FWA primarily reveal the interaction between peak aortic flow and proximal aortic diameter/stiffness. FWA is strongly dependent on rectified reflections. If interpreted out of context with the hemodynamic principles of its derivation, the FWA paradigm inappropriately amplifies the role of the proximal aorta in elevation of FWA and PP. © 2016 The Authors.","Arterial stiffness; Characteristic impedance; Forward wave amplitude; Ventricular-arterial coupling; Wave reflections","Age Factors; Aged; Animals; Aorta; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dogs; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Animal; Models, Cardiovascular; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulsatile Flow; Pulse Wave Analysis; Regional Blood Flow; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Vascular Stiffness; Ventricular Function, Left; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal tissue; aorta; arterial stiffness; Article; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; forward pressure wave amplitude; heart hemodynamics; human; human tissue; limit of quantitation; male; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; nonhuman; peak expiratory flow; population research; priority journal; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; age; animal; animal model; aorta; arterial stiffness; biological model; blood flow; blood pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; dog; heart left ventricle function; hemodynamics; middle aged; pathophysiology; predictive value; pulsatile flow; reproducibility; time factor","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002834158"

Methods: Circadian hemodynamics, including 24-h brachial and central blood pressure (BP), SBP variability indices, central pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AIx@75), cardiac index, and total vascular resistance (TVR), were evaluated using an oscillometric device, Mobil-O-Graph, in 60 patients with primary aldosteronism (63.4±13.3 years, 47% women) and 120 age-matched and sex-matched patients with essential hypertension. Results: Office SBP, PWV, AIx@75, and BP variability indices were similar between groups; however, 24-h brachial (124±14 vs 130±11 mmHg) as well as central (112±12 vs 120±10 mmHg) SBP was higher (both P<0.01), and the difference between 24-h brachial and central SBP (11±5 vs 9±3mmHg, P<0.05), an index of pressure amplification, was smaller in primary aldosteronism than in essential hypertension. In both groups, cardiac index decreased from daytime to nighttime (both P<0.01), but this decrease was smaller in primary aldosteronism (P<0.05). During daytime, TVR in primary aldosteronism was higher than that in essential hypertension (P<0.05), and the significant increase of TVR from daytime to night-time was lost in primary aldosteronism. In a multivariate stepwise regression model, primary aldosteronism emerged as an independent predictor of 24-h central SBP as well as the difference between 24-h brachial and central SBP. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that circadian hemodynamics in primary aldosteronism patients are characterized by increased central SBP, smaller disparity between brachial and central SBP, and disturbed circadian hemodynamic variation.

Study design Prospective, randomized, open, crossover trial. Animals Eight purpose-bred healthy Beagle dogs. Methods Each dog was administered four treatments: medetomidine 20 μg kg–1 IM alone or mixed in the same syringe with MK-467 (200 μg kg–1, 400 μg kg–1 or 600 μg kg–1). Instrumentation was performed under standardized anaesthesia. The dogs were allowed to recover before measurement of baseline values. Composite sedation scores, cardiovascular variables, i.e., heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO), mean arterial and central venous blood pressures (MAP and CVP) and arterial blood gases were recorded at baseline and for 60 minutes after treatment. Drug concentrations in venous plasma were analysed. Generalized linear mixed models for repeated measures with post hoc Bonferroni correction were used with statistical significance level set at α = 0.05. Results All treatments initially demonstrated the effects of medetomidine: HR and CO decreased and CVP increased. MAP transiently increased and then significantly decreased from baseline with the two highest MK-467 doses. The cardiovascular effects of medetomidine disappeared more rapidly with MK-467 than with medetomidine alone. With medetomidine alone, sedation scores remained high until the end of the 60 minute follow-up. Maximum concentrations of medetomidine were more rapidly achieved and were higher with MK-467. Conclusions and clinical relevance Initial haemodynamic effects of medetomidine were not prevented by MK-467, but these effects were attenuated and their duration shortened by MK-467, independently of dose. Absorption of medetomidine was accelerated by MK-467, when administered concomitantly IM, resulting in faster sedation; addition of MK-467 shortened the sedative effect of medetomidine. © 2017 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists and American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia","alpha<sub>2</sub>-agonist; dog; medetomidine; MK-467; peripheral alpha<sub>2</sub>-antagonist","Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Antagonists; Animals; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Cross-Over Studies; Dogs; Female; Heart Rate; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Injections, Intramuscular; Male; Medetomidine; Prospective Studies; Quinolizines; dorbene; hemoglobin; isoflo; isoflurane; medetomidine; n [2 (1,3,4,6,7,12b hexahydro 2' oxospiro[2h benzofuro[2,3 a]quinolizine 2,4' imidazolidin] 3' yl)ethyl]methanesulfonamide; propofol; propovet; alpha 2 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; hypnotic sedative agent; medetomidine; quinolizine derivative; vatinoxan; animal experiment; arterial gas; artery catheter; Article; blood carbon dioxide tension; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure variability; body temperature; breathing rate; cardiovascular effect; cardiovascular parameters; dog; eyelid reflex; female; follow up; heart output; heart rate; hemodynamic parameters; high performance liquid chromatography; male; mean arterial pressure; measurement precision; nonhuman; open study; outcome variable; prospective study; pulse oximetry; rectum temperature; recumbency; scoring system; sedation score; tandem mass spectrometry; venous pressure; animal; blood; blood pressure; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug effect; intramuscular drug administration; randomized controlled trial; veterinary","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85029626014"

Moreover, pulse pressure (PP) has not been considered as a potent hemodynamic parameter to describe BP variability during MT. We assessed the impact of PP variability on functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion during MT. Methods and Results-—Acute ischemic stroke patients presenting with large vessel occlusion from January 2012 to June 2016 were included. BP data during MT were prospectively collected in the ETIS (Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke) registry. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between PP coefficients of variation and functional outcome at 3 months (modified Rankin Scale). Among the 343 included patients, PP variability was significantly associated with worse 3- month modified Rankin Scale in univariable (odds ratio [OR]=1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24–1.96 per 1-unit increase, P=0.0002) and multivariable ordinal logistic regression (adjusted OR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.09–1.79, P=0.008). PP variability was also associated with unfavorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3–6) in univariable (OR=1.53, 95% CI: 1.17–2.01, P=0.002) and multivariable analysis (adjusted OR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.02–1.98, P=0.04). There was an association between PP variability and 3- month all-cause mortality in univariable analysis (OR= 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01–1.85 per 1-unit increase of the coefficient of variation of the PP, P=0.04), which did not remain significant after adjustment for potential confounders. Conclusions-—PP variability during MT is an independent predictor of worse clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients. These findings support the need for a close monitoring of BP variability during MT. Whether pharmacological interventions aiming at reducing BP variability during MT could impact functional outcome needs to be determined. © 2018 The Authors.","Blood pressure; Blood pressure measurement/monitoring; Ischemic stroke; Pulse pressure; Thrombectomy","Acute Disease; Aged; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Brain Ischemia; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mechanical Thrombolysis; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Registries; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; age; aged; all cause mortality; Article; blood pressure variability; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; female; general anesthesia; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; mechanical thrombectomy; multicenter study; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; pulse pressure; pulse pressure variability; Rankin scale; recanalization; register; stroke patient; systolic blood pressure; acute disease; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; brain ischemia; clinical trial; follow up; mechanical thrombectomy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; register; time factor; x-ray computed tomography","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055618309"

Arterial properties influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. We identified potential determinants of arterial function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. Relationships of traditional cardiovascular risk factors and RA characteristics with arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity), wave reflection (augmentation index, reflected wave pressure, and reflection magnitude), and pressure pulsatility (central systolic and pulse pressure, peripheral pulse pressure, pulse pressure amplification, and forward wave pressure) were identified in multivariable backward regression models among 177 patients without established CVD (118 white, 32 Asian, 22 black, 5 mixed ancestry). Results. Recorded characteristics explained 37% (pulse wave velocity) to 71% (reflected wave pressure) of the variability in arterial function. These factors were particularly associated with wave reflection and pressure pulsatility: RA duration (p = 0.04), rheumatoid factor status (p = 0.01 to 0.03), leukocyte counts (p = 0.02 to 0.05), and total cholesterol (p < 0.01 to 0.03). Body mass index (p < 0.01 to 0.02) and insulin resistance (p < 0.01 to 0.01) were related to reduced wave reflection and peripheral pulse pressure. Exercise (p = 0.02) and alcohol consumption (p < 0.01) were associated with increased pulse pressure amplification and decreased peripheral pulse pressure, respectively. Tumor necrosis factor-α inhibition (p < 0.01) was related to reduced pulse wave velocity, and tetracycline use (p = 0.02) to decreased peripheral pulse pressure. Conclusion. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and disease characteristics are consistently associated with vascular hemodynamic alterations in RA. The relative effect of arterial stiffness, wave reflection, and pressure pulsatility on CVD risk in RA needs further study. © The Journal of Rheumatology 2017.","","Adult; Aged; Arteries; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Body Mass Index; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; Risk Factors; Vascular Stiffness; abatacept; azathioprine; chloroquine; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; leflunomide; methotrexate; rheumatoid factor; salazosulfapyridine; tetracycline; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; adult; alcohol consumption; analysis of variance; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; body mass; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; disease duration; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; ethnicity; European; exercise; female; homeostasis model assessment; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; medical society; middle aged; priority journal; pulse wave; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology; risk factor; aged; arterial stiffness; artery; blood flow velocity; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; complication; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; physiology; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027858085"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether non-invasive parameters derived from pulse oximeter measurements could predict hypotension after administering spinal anesthesia for cesarean section. Hypotension can trigger maternal nausea/vomiting and/or impairment of the utero-placental perfusion and the fetal well-being. Therefore it is important to predict and prevent this event. Objective: To perform a critical analysis of the article with emphasis in the internal and external validity of the results and conclusions. Materials and Methods: 95 cesarean section patients were studied. Before anesthesia, non invasive hemodynamic parameters were measured: perfusion index, pleth variability index, heart rate, ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency variability index, entropy of heart rate variability, as well as non invasive blood pressure (NIBP). Surgery started after achieving a sixth thoracic segment (T6) sensory block level with a combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. A colloid coload was administered. NIBP was measured every minute. Hypotension was defined as a systolic arterial presssure less than 80 mmHg or the appearence of clinical symptomatology. The hypotensive episode duration was not quantified. Results and Conclusions: This is a prospective, observational study demonstrating that the only predictor for arterial hypotension is heart rate, albeit with moderate sensibility and poor specificity. Groups were comparable. Pre anesthesia heart rate was significantly higher in the hypotension group (84 ± 10 versus 77 ± 13 [beats·min-1]; p = 0,008).","Cesarean; Forecasting; Hypotension; Monitoring; Physiologic; Spinal anesthesia","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018823761"

Methods: We studied 22 mechanically ventilated critical patients in the intensive care unit. Patients were monitored with classical monitor and a pulse co-oximeter, with pulse sensors attached to patients’ index fingers. Hemodynamic data [heart rate (HR), perfusion index (PI), PVI, central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SPO2), peripheral blood oxygen content (SPOC) and peripheral blood hemoglobin (SPHB)] as well as the respiratory data [respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (VT), RSC and controlled airway pressure] were recorded for 15 min each at 3 different levels of PEEP (0, 5 and 10 cmH2O). Results: Different levels of PEEP (0, 5 and 10 cmH2O) had no obvious effect on RR, HR, MAP, SPO2 and SPOC. However, 10 cmH2O PEEP induced significant hemodynamic disturbances, including decreases of PI, and increases of both PVI and CVP. Meanwhile, 5 cmH2O PEEP induced no significant changes on hemodynamics such as CVP, PI and PVI, but improved the RSC. Conclusions: RSC and PVI may be useful in detecting the hemodynamic and respiratory effects of PEEP, thus may help clinicians individualize PEEP settings in mechanically ventilated patients. © 2016, The Author(s).","Perfusion index; Pleth variability index; Positive end-expiratory pressure; Respiratory system compliance","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84983268235"

This is the first study operationally defining SHATS and aimed at identifying its determinants. Methods: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (echocardiography), Common Carotid Artery plaque and increased thickness (ultrasound), and Chronic Kidney Disease (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate) indexed selective target organ damage. SHATS was operationally defined as their simultaneous presence in a patient. PWV was measured by Sphygmocor® and BP variability by 24 h ABPM. Results: SHATS affected 19.9% of the 367 studied subjects. Subjects with SHATS had a similar prevalence in diabetes mellitus, but a greater prevalence of very stiff artery (84.9 vs 64.3%, p < 0.01) and use of antihypertensive medications. In the presence of similar office BP, SHATS was associated with higher 24 h SBP and lower 24 h DBP (a greater pulsatile pressure!), reduced nighttime SBP fall, and a twofold greater prevalence of reverse dipper status (48.2 vs 20.2%, p < 0.001). BMI (positive correlation) and DBP (negative correlation) were the only traditional CV risk factors significantly associated with the odds of having SHATS. Very stiff artery and BP variability were significant independent determinants of SHATS, with highly predictive accuracy. Conclusion: SHATS, the simultaneous damage of multiple target organs, may easily operationally defined. Very stiff artery and BP variability represent key factors for SHATS. The present results support the hypothesis of SHATS as a systemic condition, needing further characterization. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Arterial stiffness; Blood pressure variability; Multiple systemic organ alteration; Pulse wave velocity; Target organ damage","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atherosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Carotid Artery Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Syndrome; Vascular Stiffness; antihypertensive agent; aged; arterial stiffness; arterial wall thickness; Article; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure variability; body mass; cardiovascular risk; carotid atherosclerosis; chronic kidney failure; common carotid artery; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic accuracy; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; drug use; echocardiography; echography; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; multiple organ failure; prevalence; priority journal; pulse pressure; pulse wave; systemic hemodynamic atherosclerotic syndrome; systolic blood pressure; target organ; arterial stiffness; atherosclerosis; blood pressure; carotid artery disease; chronic kidney failure; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; hemodynamics; hypertension; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; syndrome; very elderly","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85045105432"

This study evaluates the accuracy of point-of-care Doppler ultrasound assessment of the change in carotid corrected flow time induced by a passive leg raise maneuver as a predictor of fluid responsiveness. Noninvasive cardiac output monitoring (NICOM, Cheetah Medical, Newton Center, MA) system based on a bioreactance method was used. Design: Prospective, noninterventional study. Setting: ICU at a large academic center. Patients: Patients with new, undifferentiated shock, and vasopressor requirements despite fluid resuscitation were included. Patients with significant cardiac disease and conditions that precluded adequate passive leg raising were excluded. Interventions: Carotid corrected flow time was measured via ultrasound before and after a passive leg raise maneuver. Predicted fluid responsiveness was defined as greater than 10% increase in stroke volume on noninvasive cardiac output monitoring following passive leg raise. Images and measurements were reanalyzed by a second, blinded physician. The accuracy of change in carotid corrected flow time to predict fluid responsiveness was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Seventy-seven subjects were enrolled with 54 (70.1%) classified as fluid responders by noninvasive cardiac output monitoring. The average change in carotid corrected flow time after passive leg raise for fluid responders was 14.1±18.7ms versus -4.0±8ms for nonresponders (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that change in carotid corrected flow time is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness status (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96) and a 7ms increase in carotid corrected flow time post passive leg raise was shown to have a 97% positive predictive value and 82% accuracy in detecting fluid responsiveness using noninvasive cardiac output monitoring as a reference standard. Mechanical ventilation, respiratory rate, and high positive end expiratory pressure had no significant impact on test performance. Post hoc blinded evaluation of bedside acquired measurements demonstrated agreement between evaluators. Conclusions: Change in carotid corrected flow time can predict fluid responsiveness status after a passive leg raise maneuver. Using point-of-care ultrasound to assess change in carotid corrected flow time is an acceptable and reproducible method for noninvasive identification of fluid responsiveness in critically ill patients with undifferentiated shock.

Observational study. University hospital; study from May 2011 and May 2012. Forty-eight patients with end-renal function were included and 44 analyzed. Patients with cardiac failure were not eligible. Fluid challenges were administered during maintenance of general anesthesia but before skin incision and repeated if the patient was deemed to be a ""responder"" (increase in stroke volume ≥10%). The primary endpoint was to assess if the Pleth Variability Index is an accurate predictor of fluid responsiveness. Among 76 fluid challenges, 38 were considered as positive (increase in stroke volume measured by Doppler ≥10%). Pleth Variability Index was similar at baseline between responders and nonresponder patients. Fluid challenges were associated with a significant decrease in Pleth Variability Index in overall cases (12 [8-14] vs 10 [6-17], P=.050), but it was not able to discriminate between responders (12 [8-15] vs 10 [5-15], P=.650) and nonresponders (11 [6-16] vs 8 [5-14], P=.047). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve for Pleth Variability Index was 0.49 (0.36-0.62).

The objective of this study was to investigate the changes in RPPW along with various hemodynamic variables after acupuncture stimulation and to examine the validity of pulse diagnosis as a modern diagnostic tool. Methods: We conducted acupuncture stimulation at both ST36 acupuncture points in 25 healthy volunteers. We simultaneously assessed the RPPW by pulse tonometry; heart rate variability (HRV) by electrocardiogram; photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, respiration rate, peripheral blood flow velocity and arterial depth by ultrasonography; and cardiac output by impedance cardiography, before, during and after a session of acupuncture stimulation. Results: We observed consistent patterns of increased spectral energy at low frequency (<10 Hz) and pulse power using RPPW examination and in the amplitude and systolic area of the PPG signal during the entire acupuncture session. The low- and high-frequency domains of HRV increased and decreased, respectively, during the acupuncture session. The peripheral blood velocity rose shortly after needle insertion, reached a maximum in the middle of the session and decreased afterwards. The augmentation index (AIX) and pulse transit time (PTT) obtained from RPPW did not change significantly. Conclusion: Acupuncture stimulation at ST36 in healthy subjects increased the peripheral pulse amplitudes (pressure pulse wave (PPW) and PPG), blood flow velocity (ultrasonography) and sympathetic nerve activity (HRV). The lack of changes in the AIX and PTT suggests that the increased pulse amplitudes and blood flow velocity may result from increased cardiac output.

Assessment of intravascular volume status by point-of-care echocardiography often relies solely on inferior vena cava size and variability evaluation; however, this parameter should be interpretated with an understanding of right ventricular function integrated with stroke volume and fl ow. Attempts to optimize intra-abdominal hemodynamics favorably are clearly problematic when physical examination fi ndings or rudimentary assessments of central venous pressure or change in central venous pressure are used. Here, we have demonstrated the potential utility of point-ofcare echocardiography to optimize the hemodynamic state in patients with decompensated cirrhosis along with acute kidney injury. This case is very unique and describes how this technique may have great promise in optimizing the intra-abdominal hemodynamics and predict the timing of large-volume paracentesis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, which in turn can aid in promoting favorable renal recovery. © 2016 Southern Society for Clinical Investigation.

Methods: Twenty-four-hour ABPM and target organ damage (left ventricular mass index, pulse wave velocity, urine albumin : Creatinine ratio and carotid atherosclerotic plaques) were evaluated in 1408 individuals. Associations were examined in regression models, stratified for age [middle-aged (41 or 51 years) or elderly (61 or 71 years)], and adjusted for sex, smoking status, and total-cholesterol. Results: In middle-aged individuals, an increase of 10mmHg in 24-h SBP was independently associated with an increase of 3.8 (2.7-4.8) g/m2 in LVMI. The effect was nearly doubled in the elderly subgroup, where the same increase resulted in an increase in LVMI of 6.3 (5.0-7.6) g/ m2 (P for interaction <0.01). An increase of 10mmHg of 24-h SBP was associated with a 6.7% increase in pulse wave velocity in middle-aged individuals and with an 9.1% increase in elderly individuals (P for interaction <0.01). An independent association between 24-h ABPM and urine albumin : Creatinine ratio was only observed in the elderly subgroup. Associations between the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and components from 24-h ABPM except 24-h DBP were not modified by age (all P for interaction >0.26).

Methods 57 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean ± SD age 62.8 ± 6.9 years; BMI 31.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2; HbA1c 7.3 ± 0.6%) were included in an acute (exenatide- or placebo-infusion) and 12-week (liraglutide, sitagliptin or placebo) randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Systemic haemodynamics (oscillometric technique and finger photoplethysmography), vascular stiffness (tonometry), and sympathetic nervous system (SNS)-activity (heart rate variability) were determined in the fasting state and following a standardised mixed meal. Results In both studies, postprandial blood pressure (BP) decreased during placebo-intervention. Compared with placebo, acute exenatide-infusion increased postprandial diastolic BP (6.7 [95%-confidence interval 3.6–9.9] mmHg, p < 0.001) and vascular resistance (683.6 [438.5–928.8] dyn*s/cm5/1.73 m2, p < 0.001), while cardiac index decreased (0.6 [0.40.8] L/min/1.73 m2; p < 0.001). Systolic BP, augmentation index and SNS-activity were unaffected. Twelve-week liraglutide-treatment did not affect postprandial haemodynamics, while sitagliptin decreased diastolic BP (3.5 [0.0–6.9] mmHg; p = 0.050), vascular resistance (309.9 [66.6–553.1] dyn*s/cm5/1.73 m2; p = 0.013) and cardiac index (0.3 [0.0–0.6] L/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.040), compared with placebo. Neither liraglutide nor sitagliptin affected SNS-activity or augmentation index. All treatments significantly lowered postprandial glucose levels. Conclusions Acute exenatide-infusion prevented the meal-induced decline in diastolic BP, although prolonged liraglutide intervention did not affect postprandial haemodynamics.

This condition is clinically characterized by three distinct phases: during the first phase, sudden onset of respiratory distress and cyanosis occur within seconds followed by hypotension, shock, and loss of consciousness within minutes. Of those who survive the initial insult, 40 to 50% enter the second phase characterized by coagulopathy and hemorrhage within hours. During the third phase, acute symptoms are over, and tissue injury of the brain, lung or renal is for the most part already established. The patient may succumb due to multisystem organ failure or infection acquired in the hospital.

The aim of this work was the retrospective application of the ARCSolver algorithm to pulse wave signals acquired with the VaSera VS-1500 device to estimate central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and aPWV. Materials and methods ARCSolver estimates of cSBP and aPWV, on the basis of brachial cuff measurements, were compared pair-wise with results from the tonometric SphygmoCor device in 68 individuals (mean age 51± 18 years). We used variation estimates, correlation coefficients, age group-related t-tests, and the Bland-Altman method to analyze the reproducibility and agreement of the two methods. Results cSBP reproducibility expressed as variability was 14.9% for ARCSolver and 11.6% for SphygmoCor. PWV reproducibility was better for ARCSolver, with a variation estimate of 6.5%, compared with 20.9% using SphygmoCor. The mean cSBP difference was 0.5 mmHg (SD 6.9 mmHg) and 0.32 m/s (SD 1.20 m/s) for PWV, respectively. The agerelated differences between ARCSolver and SphygmoCor are in line with previous studies. Bland-Altman plots showed considerable agreement between the two methods without signs of systematic bias. Conclusion These results show that the combined application of the ARCSolver method with the VaSera VS-1500 device is feasible and the results are comparable with tonometric determination of cSBP and aPWV. This successful application of the ARCSolver may potentially help to improve cardiovascular risk stratification and prevention at an early stage in a community setting. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Surgical noxious stimuli generate a stress response with an increased sympathetic activity, potentially affecting the perioperative outcome. Surgical Pleth Index (SPI), derived from the pulse plethysmogram, has been proposed as a tool to assess nociception-antinociception balance. The relationship between SPI and autonomic nervous system (ANS) during general anesthesia is poorly understood and it is doubtful if SPI-guided analgesia may offer advantages over the standard clinical practice. The study was designed to evaluate if SPI-guided analgesia leads to a lower sympathetic modulation compared with standard clinical practice. Methods. Electrocardiographic wave, non-invasive blood pressure and SPI were recorded in ASA I-II patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, randomized to receive SPI-guided analgesia or standard analgesia. Hemodynamic parameters, SPI, mean and variance of heart rate, low (LF) and high frequency (HF) spectral components of heart rate variability were measured at four time points: (T0) baseline, (T1) after induction of general anesthesia, (T2) after pneumoperitoneum insufflation and (T3) after pneumoperitoneum withdrawal. Results. SPI, hemodynamic and ANS parameters changed significantly in both groups during the study period (P<0.0001). At T2 SPI and markers of sympathetic modulation were significantly lower in SPI group (mean [SD] SPI 38.1 [15.3] vs. 48.1 [16.2] normalized units, P<0.05; LF 38 [8.6] vs. 56.2 [20.6] normalized units, P<0.01; LF/HF 1.01 [1.1] vs. 2.68 [2.07], P<0.01). There was no difference in remifentanil consumption, recovery time from anesthesia, or postoperative pain and complications. Conclusion. SPI-guided analgesia led to a more stable sympathetic modulation but didn't seem to offer clinically relevant advantages over the standard clinical practice for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","Autonomic nervous system; Heart Rate; Nociception","Adolescent; Adult; Analgesia; Anesthesia, General; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Plethysmography; Prospective Studies; Sympathetic Nervous System; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult; propofol; remifentanil; adrenergic system; adult; aeration; analgesia; anesthetic recovery; Article; blood pressure; cholecystectomy; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; clinical practice; controlled study; double blind procedure; elective surgery; electrocardiography; female; general anesthesia; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; intraoperative period; male; pneumoperitoneum; postoperative pain; randomized controlled trial; surgical pleth index; adolescent; adrenergic system; analgesia; drug effects; intraoperative monitoring; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; middle aged; plethysmography; procedures; prospective study; treatment outcome; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84939557408"

We assessed the effects of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) on hemodynamic parameters and these on outcome in participants in the ENOS trial (Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke). Methods - Four thousand and eleven patients with acute stroke and raised BP were randomized within 48 hours of onset to transdermal GTN or no GTN for 7 days. Peripheral hemodynamics were measured at baseline (3 measures) and daily (2 measures) during treatment. Between-visit BP variability over days 1 to 7 (as SD) was assessed in quintiles. Functional outcome was assessed as modified Rankin Scale and cognition as telephone mini-mental state examination at day 90. Analyses were adjusted for baseline prognostic variables. Data are mean difference or odds ratios with 95% CI. Results - Increased baseline BP (diastolic, variability), heart rate, and rate-pressure product were each associated with unfavorable functional outcome at day 90. Increased between-visit systolic BP variability was associated with an unfavourable shift in modified Rankin Scale (highest quintile adjusted odds ratio, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.37-1.99), worse cognitive scores (telephone mini-mental state examination: highest quintile adjusted mean difference, -2.03; 95% CI, -2.84 to -1.22), and increased odds of death at day 90 (highest quintile adjusted odds ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.12-2.19). GTN lowered BP and rate-pressure product and increased heart rate at day 1 and reduced between-visit systolic BP variability. Conclusions - Increased between-visit BP variability was associated with poor functional and cognitive outcomes and increased death 90 days after acute stroke. In addition to lowering BP and rate-pressure product, GTN reduced between-visit systolic BP variability. Agents that lower BP variability in acute stroke require further study. © 2019 International Anesthesia Research Society.","blood pressure; glyceryl trinitrate; heart rate; hemodynamics; hemorrhage","Acute Disease; Administration, Cutaneous; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Pressure; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nitroglycerin; Stroke; Time Factors; antihypertensive agent; glyceryl trinitrate; nitric oxide; glyceryl trinitrate; aged; Article; blood pressure measurement; cerebrovascular accident; cognition; controlled study; drug effect; elevated blood pressure; female; functional assessment; heart rate; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; priority journal; pulse pressure; randomized controlled trial; Rankin scale; secondary analysis; systolic blood pressure; acute disease; blood pressure; clinical trial; cutaneous drug administration; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; pathophysiology; time factor; very elderly","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060618727"

Twenty-seven healthy older adults (13 females, 66 ± 6 years) underwent assessment of CA during steady-state changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) induced by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and phenylephrine. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using colour-coded duplex ultrasonography at the internal carotid (ICA) and vertebral arteries (VA). CA was quantified by a linear regression slope (CA slope) between percentage changes in cerebrovascular resistance (CVR = MAP/CBF) and MAP relative to baseline values. Periventricular and deep WMH volumes were measured with T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. MAP was reduced by -11 ± 7% during SNP, and increased by 21 ± 8% during phenylephrine infusion. CA demonstrated large individual variability with the CA slopes ranging from 0.37 to 2.20 at the ICA and from 0.17 to 3.18 at the VA; no differences in CA were found between the ICA and VA. CA slopes measured at the VA had positive correlations with the total and periventricular WMH volume (r = 0.55 and 0.59, P < 0.01). Collectively, these findings demonstrated the presence of large individual variability of CA in older adults, and that, when measured in the posterior cerebral circulation, it is the higher rather than lower CA reactivity that is associated with WMH severity. © 2016 The Physiological Society.","","Aged; Blood Flow Velocity; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Female; Homeostasis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis; White Matter; nitroprusside sodium; phenylephrine; vasoactive agent; age; aged; Article; autoregulation; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; brain circulation; brain size; cerebral autoregulation; cerebrovascular disease; cerebrovascular resistance; color Doppler flowmetry; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; female; hemodynamic parameters; human; human experiment; individual variability; internal carotid artery; male; mean arterial pressure; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical parameters; priority journal; radiological parameters; sex difference; steady state; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; vertebral artery; white matter hyperintensity; brain circulation; diagnostic imaging; homeostasis; middle aged; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; vascularization; white matter","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84971472411"

A 33-item questionnaire was sent to all intensive care units (ICUs) admitting patients after cardiac surgery. 71 out of 92 identified centers (77.2 %) returned a completed questionnaire. Electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry, diuresis, body temperature and blood gas analysis were identified as routinely used hemodynamic monitoring, whereas advanced monitoring was performed with pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiography. Crystalloids were the fluids of choice for volume replacement (86.8 % of Centers). To guide volume management, central venous pressure (26.7 %) and invasive blood pressure (19.7 %) were the most frequently used parameters. Dobutamine was the first choice for treatment of left heart dysfunction (40 %) and epinephrine was the first choice for right heart dysfunction (26.8 %). Half of the Centers had an internal protocol for vasoactive drugs administration. Intra-aortic balloon pump and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation were widely available among Cardiothoracic ICUs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were suspended in 28 % of the Centers. The survey shows what is considered as standard monitoring in Italian Cardiac ICUs. Standard, routinely used monitoring consists of ECG, SpO2, etCO2, invasive BP, CVP, diuresis, body temperature, and BGA. It also shows that there is large variability among the various Centers regarding hemodynamic monitoring of fluid therapy and inotropes administration. Further research is required to better standardize and define the indicators to improve the standards of intensive care after cardiac surgery among Italian cardiac ICUs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cardiac surgery; Goal-directed therapy; Hemodynamic monitoring; Inotropic drugs; Intensive care unit","Adult; Assisted Circulation; Blood Transfusion; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Cardiotonic Agents; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Italy; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Standard of Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Blood gas analysis; Blood pressure; Cardiovascular surgery; Echocardiography; Electrocardiography; Heart; Hemodynamics; Monitoring; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oximeters; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Surgery; Surveys; adrenalin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dobutamine; dopamine; enoximone; glyceryl trinitrate; hemoglobin; lactic acid; levosimendan; nitric oxide; noradrenalin; phosphodiesterase III inhibitor; prostanoid; terlipressin; vasopressin; cardiotonic agent; vasoconstrictor agent; Advanced monitoring; Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors; Cardiac surgery; Central venous pressure; Goal directed; Hemodynamic monitoring; Inotropic drugs; Internal protocols; Article; blood gas analysis; blood pressure; blood transfusion; body temperature; central venous pressure; clinical practice; diuresis; electrocardiogram; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; extracorporeal oxygenation; fluid therapy; forward heart failure; health care quality; heart left ventricle failure; heart output; heart right ventricle failure; heart surgery; hematocrit; hemodynamic monitoring; human; intensive care unit; intraaortic balloon pump; lung artery pressure; patient monitoring; perioperative period; priority journal; pulmonary artery catheterization; pulmonary hypertension; pulse oximetry; questionnaire; respiratory failure; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; vasoplegia; venous oxygen tension; adult; assisted circulation; health care quality; heart surgery; hemodynamics; intraoperative monitoring; Italy; standards; Intensive care units","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84931323471"

However, a previous study has suggested a 'grey zone' between 9 and 13% in which PPV would be inconclusive to predict fluid responsiveness. Considering PPV is based on cardiopulmonary interactions, we evaluated whether an augmented PPV using a temporary increase in tidal volume (V T) from 8 to 12 ml kg-1 has the predictability for fluid responsiveness in patients within the grey zone. Methods: Adult patients requiring general anaesthesia were enrolled. During the period when PPV was within the range of 9-13%, haemodynamic variables such as stroke volume index (SVI) and PPV with an 8 ml kg-1 tidal volume ventilation (PPV8) were obtained before and after volume expansion (6 ml kg-1) under mechanical ventilation. Augmented PPV induced by 2-min ventilation with a V T of 12 ml kg-1 (PPV12) was also recorded immediately before volume loading. The patients whose SVI increased ≥10% after volume expansion were considered responders. Results: In 38 enrolled patients, 20 were responders. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed PPV12 had an excellent predictability for fluid responsiveness {area under the curve [AUC]=0.935 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.805-0.989]; sensitivity 95%; specificity 72%; P<0.0001}. The optimal threshold for PPV12 was >17%. However, PPV8 failed to show significant predictability [AUC=0.668 (95% CI 0.497-0.812); sensitivity 65%; specificity 61%; P=0.06]. Conclusion: In mechanically ventilated patients, our augmented PPV successfully predicted fluid responsiveness in the previously suggested grey zone.

Methods Eighteen women were tested beginning at the 12th week of gestation at six time-points throughout pregnancy and six weeks postpartum. Heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, pulse transit time (PTT), respiration, and baroreceptor sensitivity were analyzed in resting conditions. Additionally, hemoglobin, asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine and Endothelin (ET-1) were obtained. Results Heart rate and sympathovagal balance favoring sympathetic drive increased, the vagal tone and the baroreflex sensitivity decreased during pregnancy. Relative sympathetic drive (sympathovagal balance) reached a maximum at 6 weeks postpartum whereas the other variables did not differ compared to first trimester levels. Postpartum diastolic blood pressure was higher compared to first and second trimester. Pulse transit time and endothelial markers showed no difference throughout gestation. However, opposing variables PTT and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were both higher six weeks postpartum. Conclusions The sympathetic up regulation throughout pregnancy goes hand in hand with a decreased baroreflex sensitivity. In the postpartum period, the autonomic nervous system, biochemical endothelial reactions and PTT show significant and opposing changes compared to pregnancy findings, indicating the complex aftermath of the increase of blood volume, the changes in perfusion strategies and blood pressure regulation that occur in pregnancy. © 2018 Kolovetsiou-Kreiner et al.

Cardiac preload optimization is a prerequisite to improve hemodynamics. We evaluated the clinical usefulness of dynamic indices for the prediction of fluid responsiveness in BCP patients under general anesthesia. Forty-two patients in the BCP under mechanical ventilation received colloids at 6 ml/kg for 10 min. Stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), pleth variability index (PVI), and hemodynamic data were measured before and after the fluid challenge. Patients were considered responders to volume expansion if the stroke volume index increased by ≥15 %. The areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for SVV, PPV and PVI were 0.83, 0.81 and 0.74, respectively (p < 0.05), with the corresponding optimal cut-off values of 12, 15 and 10 %.

Methods: Volunteers (n = 470) without medication with cardiovascular effects were examined using radial pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography, and heart rate variability analysis. Based on the passive head-up tilt induced changes in systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output, the principal determinants of blood pressure, a cluster analysis was performed. Results: The haemodynamic response could be clustered into 3 categories: upright increase in vascular resistance and decrease in cardiac output were greatest in the first (+45 % and -27 %, respectively), smallest in the second (+2 % and -2 %, respectively), and intermediate (+22 % and -13 %, respectively) in the third group. These groups were named as 'constrictor' (n = 109), 'sustainer' (n = 222), and 'intermediate' (n = 139) phenotypes, respectively. The sustainers were characterized by male predominance, higher body mass index, blood pressure, and also by higher pulse wave velocity, an index of large arterial stiffness, than the other groups (p < 0.01 for all). Heart rate variability analysis showed higher supine and upright low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio in the sustainers than constrictors, indicating increased sympathovagal balance. Upright LF/HF ratio was also higher in the sustainer than intermediate group. In multivariate analysis, independent explanatory factors for higher pulse wave velocity were the sustainer (p < 0.022) and intermediate phenotypes (p < 0.046), age (p < 0.001), body mass index (p < 0.001), and hypertension (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The response to upright posture could be clustered to 3 functional phenotypes. The sustainer phenotype, with smallest upright decrease in cardiac output and highest sympathovagal balance, was independently associated with increased large arterial stiffness. These results indicate an association of the functional haemodynamic phenotype with an acknowledged marker of cardiovascular risk.

Today, different minimally- and non-invasive hemodynamic monitoring systems measure functional hemodynamic parameters. Although some of these parameters are described by the same name, they differ in their measurement technique and thus may provide different results. We aimed to test the performance of seven functional hemodynamic parameters simultaneously in the same clinical setting. Methods: Hemodynamic measurements were done in 30 cardiac surgery patients that were mechanically ventilated. Before and after a standardized intravenous fluid bolus, hemodynamics were measured by the following monitoring systems: PiCCOplus (SVV                             PiCCO                             , PPV                             PiCCO                             ), LiDCO                             rapid                              (SVV                             LiDCO                             , PPV                             LiDCO                             ), FloTrac (SVV                             FloTrac                             ), Philips Intellivue (PPV                             Philips                             ) and Masimo pulse oximeter (pleth variability index, PVI). Prediction of fluid responsiveness was tested by calculation of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves including a gray zone approach and compared using Fisher's Z-Test. Results: Fluid administration resulted in an increase in cardiac output, while all functional hemodynamic parameters decreased. A wide range of areas under the ROC-curve (AUC's) was observed: AUC-SVV                             PiCCO                              = 0.91, AUC-PPV                             PiCCO                              = 0.88, AUC-SVV                             LiDCO                              = 0.78, AUC-PPV                             LiDCO                              = 0.89, AUC-SVV                             FloTrac                              = 0.87, AUC-PPV                             Philips                              = 0.92 and AUC-PVI = 0.68. Optimal threshold values for prediction of fluid responsiveness ranged between 9.5 and 17.5%. Lowest threshold values were observed for SVV                             LiDCO                             , highest for PVI. Conclusion: All functional hemodynamic parameters tested except for PVI showed that their use allows a reliable identification of potential fluid responders. PVI however, may not be suitable after cardiac surgery to predict fluid responsiveness.                          © 2018 The Author(s).","Functional hemodynamic parameter; Pleth variability index; Pulse pressure variation; Pulse wave analysis; Stroke volume variation","Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration, Artificial; Water-Electrolyte Balance; infusion fluid; adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical article; female; heart hemodynamics; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; heart surgery; hemodynamic parameters; human; male; mean arterial pressure; pleth variability index; prediction; pulse pressure variation; pulse wave; retrospective study; stroke volume variation; surgical patient; ventilated patient; artificial ventilation; electrolyte balance; fluid therapy; heart surgery; hemodynamics; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; reproducibility","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85047312393"

Materials and methods. We retrospectively formed a group of patients with stage II grade 1–2 EAH who had not previously received regular antihypertensive therapy (AHT) (n=52, mean age 52.9±6.0 years). All patients were treated with I/P SPC and all of them achieved target office BP level (less than 140/90 mm Hg). After 12 weeks of follow-up (from the time of reaching the target BP) assessment of AHT effectiveness (general clinical data, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring [ABPM], volume sphygmography, echocardiography), and vascular stiffness evaluation were performed. Results. At the end of follow-up office systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), pulse BP, day-time, night-time and 24-hour SBP and DBP significantly (p<0.001 for all) decreased. According to the ABPM data day-time, night- time, and 24-hour systolic BPV significantly decreased (p=0.029, p=0.006 and p<0.001, respectively); day-time and 24-hour diastolic BPV also significantly decreased (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Day-night standard deviation (SDdn) significantly decreased too (p=0.002 and p<0.001, respectively). Volumetric sphygmography showed significant decrease of right cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) (from 8.20±1.29 to 7.58±1.44, p=0.001) and of left CAVI (from 8.13±1.40 to 7.46±1.43, p<0.001), as well as reduction of the number o f patients with a right- and/or left-CAVI >9.0 (from 32.7 to 11.5%, p=0.018). According to assessment of arterial stiffness us- ing the Vasotens24 software package, the arterial stiffness index (ASI) significantly (p<0.001) decreased from 153.5±29.9 to 138.3±20.0 (by –9.2±13.1%). Transthoracic echocardiography data demonstrated significant decrease (p<0.001) in effective arterial elastance (from 1.82±0.43 to 1.58±0.36 mm Hg; by –11.85±16.29%) and significant (p<0.001) increase in the arterial compliance – from 1.27±0.34 to 1.54±0.38 mm Hg/ml (+26.95±38.06%). Conclusion. In AHT naive patients 40–65 years old with stage II grade 1–2 EAH therapy with I/P SPC provided effective 24-hour BP control, reduced BPV and improved arterial stiffness parameters. © 2019 Media Sphera Publishing Group.

Patients and methods Eighty-seven (60% men) participants, with a mean age of 34.26± 16.58 years, were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. All patients were subjected to sequential measures of carotid PWA by two experienced operators. In a group of 27 patients, PWA was also determined 1 month after the first evaluation to address the temporal stability of the PWA estimations with the device. Results The analysis of concordance revealed a very good agreement for paired PWA values, regarding both intraobserver variability and interobserver variability and also the temporal variability. Intraclass correlation coefficients above 0.9 were calculated for central systolic blood pressure, central pulse pressure, and the augmentation index, in all three conditions. Small mean differences for intraobserver, interobserver, and temporal reproducibility were also observed for the three major parameters: -0.5 mmHg [limits of agreement (LOA): 9.1;8.1], 0.1 mmHg (LOA: 6.6;6.8), and -0.3 mmHg (LOA: 10.2;9.6), respectively, for central systolic blood pressure; 0.4 mmHg (LOA: 6.2;6.9), 1.0 mmHg (LOA: 6.0;8.1), and -0.4 mmHg (LOA: 6.7;6.1), respectively, for central pulse pressure; and 0.8% (LOA: 14.0;15.5), 0.1% (LOA: 15.6;15.9), and -0.1% (LOA: 16.2;16.1), respectively, for the augmentation index. The observed correlations were independent of sex, age, arterial pressure, heart rate, and BMI. Conclusion The data demonstrated an excellent reproducibility of the Complior Analyse for the assessment of central hemodynamic parameters, when used in ideal conditions and by experienced observers.

Asians show greater morning surges in blood pressure (BP) and a steeper slope illustrating the link between higher BP and the risk of CVD events. It is thus particularly important for Asian hypertensives to achieve 24-h BP control, including morning and night-time control. There are three components of ‘perfect 24-h BP control:’ the 24-h BP level, nocturnal BP dipping, and BP variability (BPV), such as the morning BP surge that can be assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring. The morning BP-guided approach using home BP monitoring (HBPM) is the first step toward perfect 24-h BP control, followed by the control of nocturnal HTN. We have been developing new HBPM devices that can measure nocturnal BP. BPV includes different time-phase variability from the shortest beat-by-beat, positional, diurnal, day-by-day, visit-to-visit, seasonal, and yearly changes. The synergistic resonance of each type of BPV would produce a great dynamic BP surge (resonance hypothesis), which triggers a CVD event, especially in the high-risk patients with systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome (SHATS). In the future, the innovative management of HTN based on the simultaneous assessment of the resonance of all of the BPV phenotypes using a beat by beat wearable ‘surge’ BP monitoring device (WSP) and an information and communication technology (ICT)-based data analysis system will produce a paradigm shift from ‘dots’ BP management to ‘seamless’ ultimate individualized ‘anticipation medication’ for reaching a zero CVD event rate. © 2016 The Author","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; Anticipation medicine; Blood pressure variability; Home blood pressure monitoring; Information and communication technology; Morning hypertension; Nocturnal hypertension; Perfect 24-h blood pressure control; Systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome; Wearable blood pressure monitoring","Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; Circadian Rhythm; Disease Management; Humans; Hypertension; aldosterone antagonist; alpha adrenergic receptor blocking agent; amlodipine; amlodipine plus telmisartan; angiotensin receptor antagonist; azilsartan; biological marker; calcium channel blocking agent; candesartan; chlortalidone; diuretic agent; doxazosin; hydrochlorothiazide; valsartan; anticipation medicine; arterial stiffness; atrial fibrillation; bedtime dosage; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure variability; cardio ankle vascular index; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; combination drug therapy; diabetic hypertension; dosage schedule comparison; ethnic difference; home monitoring; human; hypertension; hypothesis; information technology; kidney denervation; low drug dose; morning dosage; personalized medicine; prognostic assessment; pulse wave; resonance hypothesis; Review; risk assessment; sodium restriction; systemic hemodynamic atherothrombotic syndrome; thrombosis; tonometry; white coat hypertension; Asian continental ancestry group; blood pressure; circadian rhythm; disease management; ethnology; hypertension; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965057078"

Here, we investigated whether diclofenac (non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-1 and 2, COX-1/COX-2), celecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor) or SC560 (selective COX-1 inhibitor) interact variably with haemodynamic effects of CSA in conscious female rats. Changes caused by CSA (10 mg/kg i.v.) in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV) and myocardial contractility were assessed in the absence and presence of individual NSAIDs (10 mg/kg each). Compared with vehicle values, CSA caused immediate and sustained (i) increases in BP and decreases in pulse pressure index (PPI) and HR, (ii) elevations in left ventricular (LV) contractility (dP/dtmax) and isovolumic relaxation constant (Τau) and (iii) increases in the time- and frequency-domain indices of HRV and shifted the cardiac sympathovagal balance towards parasympathetic dominance. CSA hypertension was abolished in rats pre-treated with celecoxib and intensified in the presence of diclofenac or SC560. Alternatively, the CSA-evoked decreases in PPI, increases in HRV indices and cardiac parasympathetic dominance were blunted by celecoxib in contrast to no effect for diclofenac or SC560. Similarly, celecoxib, but not other NSAIDs, eliminated the elevated LV contractility (dP/dtmax) and isovolumic relaxation constant (Τau, τ), which reflect cardiac systolic and diastolic function, respectively, that accompanied the CSA-induced pressure load. The data underscore the preferential capacity of selective COX-2 inhibition by celecoxib to mitigate CSA hypertension and consequent alterations in cardiac performance and autonomic balance. By contrast, CSA effects are preserved or even exacerbated after COX-1 inhibition. © 2017 Nordic Association for the Publication of BCPT (former Nordic Pharmacological Society)","","Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Celecoxib; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Cyclosporine; Diclofenac; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Pyrazoles; Rats; Rats, Wistar; 5 (4 chlorophenyl) 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 3 trifluoromethyl 1h pyrazole; celecoxib; cyclosporin; diclofenac; indometacin; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prostaglandin synthase; tau protein; celecoxib; cyclosporine; diclofenac; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prostaglandin synthase inhibitor; pyrazole derivative; animal experiment; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular effect; comparative study; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; enzyme inhibition; female; follow up; heart left ventricle contractility; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle pressure; heart muscle contractility; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamics; hypertension; nonhuman; parasympathetic tone; pressor response; priority journal; pulse pressure; rat; systolic blood pressure; animal; autonomic nervous system; drug effects; physiology; Wistar rat","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85014734111"

Infusion tests (ITs) are usually performed to study CSF circulation and in the preoperatory evaluation of patients with hydrocephalus. The study of intracranial pressure (ICP) signals recorded during ITs could be useful to gain insight into the underlying pathophysiology of this condition and to further support treatment decisions. In this study, two wavelet parameters, wavelet turbulence (WT) and wavelet entropy (WE), were analysed in order to characterise the variability, irregularity and similarity in spectral content of ICP signals in hydrocephalus. Methods One hundred and twelve ICP signals were analysed using WT and WE. These parameters were calculated in two frequency bands: B1 (0.15–0.3 Hz) and B2 (0.67–2.5 Hz). Each signal was divided into four artefact-free epochs corresponding to the basal, early infusion, plateau and recovery phases of the IT. We calculated the mean and standard deviation of WT and WE and analysed whether these parameters revealed differences between epochs of the IT. Results Statistically significant differences (p < 1.70⋅10−3, Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) in pairwise comparisons between phases of ITs were found using the mean and standard deviation of WT and WE. These differences were mainly found in B2. Conclusions Wavelet parameters like WT and WE revealed changes in the signal time-scale representation during ITs. Statistically significant differences were mainly found in B2, associated with ICP pulse waves, and included a higher degree of similarity in the spectral content, together with a lower irregularity and variability in the plateau phase with respect to the basal phase. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Hydrocephalus; Infusion test; Intracranial pressure; Wavelet entropy; Wavelet turbulence","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Hydrocephalus; Intracranial Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Entropy; Frequency bands; Signal processing; Statistics; Turbulence; Cerebro spinal fluids; Dynamical properties; Hydrocephalus; Intra-cranial pressure; Mean and standard deviations; Statistically significant difference; Wavelet entropies; Wilcoxon signed rank test; adult; aged; amplifier; Article; cerebrospinal fluid pressure; clinical decision making; female; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; human; hydrocephalus; infusion pump; intracranial pressure; intracranial pressure monitoring; lumbar infusion test; major clinical study; male; needle; pressure transducer; signal detection; wavelet analysis; hydrocephalus; middle aged; pathophysiology; very elderly; Cerebrospinal fluid","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84978517784"

The study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasonographically measured inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVC CI) in comparison to central venous pressure (CVP) in predicting fluid responsiveness in septic shock. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six patients of septic shock requiring ventilatory support (invasive/noninvasive) were included. Patients with congestive heart failure, raised intra-abdominal pressure, and poor echo window were excluded from the study. They were randomly divided into two groups based on mode of fluid resuscitation-Group I (CVP) and Group II (IVC CI). Primary end-points were mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥65 mmHg and CVP >12 mmHg or IVC CI <20% in Groups I and II, respectively. Patients were followed till achievement of end-points or maximum of 6 h. Outcome variables (pulse rate, MAP, urine output, pH, base deficit, and ScvO 2 ) were serially measured till the end of the study. Survival at 2 and 4 weeks was used as secondary end-point. Results: Primary end-point was reached in 31 patients (15 in Group I and 16 in Group II). Fluid infusion, by either method, had increased CVP and decreased IVC CI with resultant negative correlation between them (Pearson correlation coefficient-0.626). There was no significant difference in the amount of fluid infused and time to reach end-point in two groups. Comparison in outcome variables at baseline and end-point showed no significant difference including mortality. Conclusion: CVP and IVC CI are negatively correlated with fluid resuscitation, and both methods can be used for resuscitation, with IVC CI being noninferior to CVP. © 2016 Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine.","Central venous pressure; fluid responsiveness; hypovolemia; septic shock; sonographic inferior vena cava variability","adult; Article; cardiovascular parameters; central venous pressure; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; comparative study; controlled study; echocardiography; female; fluid responsiveness; fluid resuscitation; follow up; human; inferior cava vein; inferior vena cava collapsibility index; male; mean arterial pressure; outcome assessment; prospective study; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial; septic shock; urine pH; urine volume","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85007035083"

Methods Two groups (60-Y/O and 20-Y/O) were subjected to OT (three 5-minute periods: baseline supine, upright standing, recovery supine). Continuous electrocardiogram was recorded and heart rate variability (HRV) analysed. At the end of each period pulse wave analysis was performed (Sphygmocor, AtCor Medical). Results We observed significantly higher radial and central systolic and pulse pressures in the adults at baseline. We found out reduced efficiency of the hemodynamic compensatory response to orthostasis in the 60-Y/O group: mild heart rate increase (75 ± 2 vs. 88 ± 3 beats per minute); moderate aortic systolic pressure reduction (124 ± 6 to 119 ± 5 vs. 99 ± 2 to 101 ± 3 mm Hg); considerable aortic pulse pressure decrease (47 ± 4 to 38 ± 3 vs. 27 ± 2 to 22 ± 2 mm Hg); absence of diastolic pressure elevation. The adults showed significantly higher baseline augmentation indices (AIx); the young responded to the upright position with noticeable reduction of AIx most probably resulting from the pronounced tachycardia and the consequent delayed timing of pulse wave return. HRV data showed milder sympathetic activation in the 60-Y/O individuals in response to OT as compared to the 20-Y/O. Conclusions Pulse wave analysis provided new knowledge concerning the age-related hemodynamic response pattern to active orthostasis. We believe the underlying mechanism was the ‘physiological’ arterial stiffening with aging and the ensuing reduced arterial baroreflex sensitivity. HRV data for lesser sympathetic activation in response to the orthostatic challenge in the 60-Y/O group supported this assumption. © 2017 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology","Active orthostatic test; Arterial stiffness; Augmentation index; Heart rate variability; Pulse wave analysis","active orthostatic test; adult; applanation tonometry; arterial stiffness; Article; cardiovascular equipment; cardiovascular system examination; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiogram; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; middle aged; non invasive measurement; normal human; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; pulse pressure; pulse wave; sphygmomanometer; standing; systolic blood pressure; tonometry; young adult","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85026387377"

Pulse transit time (PTT) is a well-known cardiovascular parameter which is highly correlated with BP and has been widely applied in the estimation of continuous BP. However, due to the complexity of cardiovascular system, the accuracy of PTT-based BP estimation is still unsatisfactory. Recent studies indicate that, for the subjects before and after exercise, PTT can track the high-frequency BP oscillation (HF-BP) well, but is inadequate to follow the low-frequency BP variance (LF-BP). Unfortunately, the cause for this failure of PTT in LF-BP estimation is still unclear. Based on these previous researches, we investigated the cause behind this failure of PTT in LF-BP estimation. The heart rate- (HR-) related arterial baroreflex (ABR) model was introduced to analyze the failure of PTT in LF-BP estimation. Data from 42 healthy volunteers before and after exercise were collected to evaluate the correlation between the ABR sensitivity and the estimation error of PTT-based BP in LF and HF components. In the correlation plot, an obvious difference was observed between the LF and HF groups. The correlation coefficient r for the ABR sensitivity with the estimation error of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) in LF was 0.817 ± 0.038 and 0.757 ± 0.069, respectively. However, those correlation coefficient r for the ABR sensitivity with the estimation error of SBP and DBP in HF was only 0.403 ± 0.145 and 0.274 ± 0.154, respectively. These results indicated that there is an ABR-related complex LF autonomic regulation mechanism on BP, PTT, and HR, which influences the effect of PTT in LF-BP estimation. © 2018 Yang Xu et al.","","Adult; Algorithms; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Pulse Wave Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Young Adult; acclimatization; adult; Article; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular system; correlation coefficient; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiogram; exercise; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; human experiment; measurement accuracy; normal human; oscillation; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse rate; pulse transit time; rest; sitting; systolic blood pressure; treadmill exercise; vital sign; algorithm; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; exercise; female; male; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; signal processing; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056254484"

Methods: 42 CKD patients (21—without dialysis and 21—on PD) and 25 healthy controls were recruited in this study. BRS was determined by spontaneous sequence method. Short-term heart rate variability (HRV) and blood pressure variability (BPV) were assessed using power spectrum analysis of RR intervals and systolic blood pressure by time domain and frequency domain analysis. Arterial stiffness indices were assessed by carotid-femoral PWV using Sphygmocor Vx device (AtCor Medical, Australia). Results: CKD patients had significantly high PWV and low BRS as compared to healthy controls. PWV had a significant negative correlation with BRS in CKD patients (Spearman r = −0.7049, P < 0.0001; BRS-Systolic BP). On subgroup analysis, PWV was higher with lower BRS in CKD patients on peritoneal dialysis (CKD-PD) as compared to those not on dialysis (CKD-ND). Negative relationship between PWV and BRS was found in both the groups. In addition, BRS was found to have a positive correlation with HRV in CKD patients as well as both the subgroups. Conclusion: Reduction in BRS is strongly associated with increase in PWV in PD patients. Large arterial stiffness probably explains this simultaneous impairment in baroreflex functioning and increase in pulse wave velocity observed in these patients. CKD patients are characterized by poor hemodynamic profile (low BRS, high PWV, and low HRV), and peritoneal dialysis patients had further worsened profile as compared to non-dialysis group. © 2015, Japanese Society of Nephrology.","Baroreflex sensitivity; Blood pressure variability; Chronic kidney disease; Heart rate variability; Peritoneal dialysis; Pulse wave velocity","Adult; Baroreflex; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis; Pulse Wave Analysis; Vascular Stiffness; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; baroreflex sensitivity; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular parameters; chronic kidney disease; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; heart rate variability; hemodialysis patient; human; male; middle aged; observational study; peritoneal dialysis; power spectrum; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse wave; RR interval; systolic blood pressure; arterial stiffness; case control study; Kidney Failure, Chronic; pathophysiology; peritoneal dialysis; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse wave","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84940883555"

However, the reports on the impact of HPMA–DOX conjugates on the cardiovascular system such as blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were in restrained animals using tail cuff and/or other methods that lacked the resolution and sensitivity. Herein, we employed radiotelemetric-spectral-echocardiography approach to further understand the in vivo cardiovascular hemodynamics and variability post administration of free DOX and HPMA–DOX. Rats implanted with radio-telemetry device were administered intravenously with DOX (5 mg/kg), HPMA–DOX (5 mg DOX equivalent/kg) and HPMA copolymer and subjected to continuous cardiovascular monitoring and echocardiography for 140 days. We found that DOX-treated rats had ruffled fur, reduced body weight (BW) and a low survival rate. Although BP and HR were normal, spectral analysis indicated that their BP and HR variabilities were reduced. All rats exhibited typical signs of cardiotoxicity at histopathology. In contrast, HPMA–DOX rats gained weight over time and survived. Although BP, HR and related variabilities were unaffected, the left ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV) of these rats, as well as of the HPMA copolymer-treated rats, was found increased at the end of observation period. Additionally, HPMA copolymer caused microscopic injury of the heart tissue. All of these suggest the necessity of caution when employing HPMA as carrier for prolonged drug delivery. The current study also indicates the potential of radiotelemetric-spectral-echocardiography approach for improved preclinical cardiovascular risk assessment of polymer–drug conjugate and other nano-sized-drug constructs. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, postoperative orthostatic hypotension and intolerance (OI) may delay early ambulation. The mechanisms of postoperative OI include impaired vasopressor responses relating to postoperative autonomic dysfunction. Thus, based on a previous study on haemodynamic responses during mobilization before and after elective total hip arthroplasty (THA), we performed secondary analyses of heart rate variability (HRV) and aimed to identify possible abnormal postoperative autonomic responses in relation to postural change. Methods: A standardized mobilization protocol before, 6 and 24 h after surgery was performed in 23 patients scheduled for elective THA. Beat-to-beat arterial blood pressure was measured by photoplethysmography and HRV was derived from pulse wave interbeat intervals and analysed in the time and frequency domain as well as by non-linear analysis using sample entropy Results: Before surgery, arterial pressures and HR increased upon standing, while HRV low (LF) and high frequency (HF) components remained unchanged. At 6 and 24 h after surgery, resting total HRV power, sample entropy and postural responses in arterial pressures decreased compared to preoperative conditions. During standing HF variation increased by 16.7 (95 % CI 8.0-25.0) normalized units (nu) at 6 h and 10.7 (2.0-19.4) nu at 24 h compared to the preoperative evaluation. At 24 h the LF/HF ratio decreased from 1.8 (1.2-2.6) nu when supine to 1.2 (0.8-1.8) nu when standing. Conclusions: This study observed postoperative autonomic cardiovascular dysregulation that may contribute to limited HRV responses during early postoperative mobilization.

Design: Acute and 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre, parallel-group trial. Methods: In total, 57 type 2 diabetes patients (mean ± s.d. age: 62.8 ± 6.9 years; BMI: 31.8 ± 4.1 kg/m2; HbA1c: 7.3 ± 0.6%), treated with metformin and/or sulfonylureas, were included between July 2013 and August 2015. In the acute study, the GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide (n = 29) or placebo (saline 0.9%; n = 28) was infused intravenously. Subsequently, patients were again randomised to receive the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (n = 19) or matching placebo (n = 17) for 12 weeks. RHR and blood pressure (BP) were measured by oscillometric technique, systemic haemodynamics by finger photoplethysmography, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity by heart rate variability and arterial stiffness by applanation tonometry. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01744236). Results: Exenatide-infusion increased RHR (mean ± s.e.m. +7.5 ± 0.9 BPM, P < 0.001), and systolic and diastolic BP (both P < 0.05), compared with placebo. Vascular resistance increased during exenatide-infusion, whereas stroke volume and arterial stiffness decreased (P < 0.05). SNS activity and cardiac output were unaffected. Twelve-week treatment with liraglutide increased RHR (+6.6 ± 2.1 BPM), while reducing systolic BP (-12.6 ± 4.7 mmHg) and stroke volume (all P < 0.01). Cardiac output, vascular resistance, arterial stiffness and SNS activity remained unchanged (all P > 0.05). Conclusions: RHR acceleration with acute and 12-week GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment in type 2 diabetes patients is not explained by changes in SNS activity, and our data argue against vasodilation.

Pulse oximetry monitoring allows for continuous noninvasive monitoring of hemoglobin oxygenation and thus provides estimation of end-organ oxygenation. This review aims to provide an overview of pulse oximetry and discuss its current and potential clinical use during neonatal intensive care. Recent findings Technological advances in continuous assessment of dynamic changes in systemic oxygenation with pulse oximetry during transition to extrauterine life and beyond provide additional details about physiological interactions among the key hemodynamic factors regulating systemic blood flow distribution along with the subtle changes that are frequently transient and undetectable with standard monitoring. Summary Noninvasive real-Time continuous systemic oxygen monitoring has the potential to serve as biomarkers for early-organ dysfunction, to predict adverse short-Term and long-Term outcomes in critically ill neonates, and to optimize outcomes. Further studies are needed to establish values predicting adverse outcomes and to validate targeted interventions to normalize abnormal values to improve outcomes. © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Using data from 25 patients, we determined blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity-time integral. By superimposing the radial arterial waveform on the continuous wave Doppler waveform of the LVOT, obtained by transesophageal echo, we were able to determine pulse transit time and to calculate PWV, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and systemic vascular resistance (SVR).

However, the substantial pressure applied locally to the carotid artery with applanation tonometry might well evoke a baroreceptor response, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension. Therefore, when carotid and femoral tonometry are performed sequentially, baroreceptor activation could lead to different hemodynamic conditions between carotid and femoral acquisitions. Combining those acquisitions into one pulse wave velocity measure would be erroneous. In this study, we assessed whether carotid applanation tonometry has an influence on heart rate and blood pressure. METHODS In 26 hypertensive subjects, heart rate and blood pressure were assessed by continuous finger pulse waveform recording during carotid as well as femoral applanation tonometry. Both carotid and femoral acquisitions were measured in alternation and in triplicate. Median averaging over the 3 carotid and femoral measurements, respectively, was used to obtain a subject's median heart rate and blood pressure during carotid as well as femoral tonometry. RESULTS Difference in heart rate during carotid and femoral tonometry was-0.7±2.2 bpm. Differences in systolic, pulse, and diastolic blood pressure were-0.7±6.8,-0.1±3.8, and-0.3±3.5mm Hg, respectively. All differences were statistically nonsignificant. Confidence intervals were used to calculate the maximum absolute difference at 95% certainty, which was 1.6 bpm for heart rate and ≤3.5mm Hg for all blood pressures. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that in our study, carotid artery applanation tonometry as performed by an experienced researcher did not cause clinically significant baroreceptor activation. © 2015 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

Unfortunately, the arterial stiffness distribution across the human body is difficult to measure experimentally. We propose a numerical approach to determine the arterial stiffness distribution of an arterial network using a subject-specific one-dimensional model. The proposed approach calibrates the optimal parameters of the reduced-order model, including the arterial stiffness, by solving an inverse problem associated with the noninvasive in vivo measurements. An uncertainty quantification analysis has also been carried out to measure the contribution of the model input parameters variability, alone or by interaction with other inputs, to the variation of clinically relevant hemodynamic indices, here the arterial pulse pressure. The results obtained for a lower limb model, demonstrate that the numerical approach presented here can provide a robust and subject-specific tool to the practitioner, allowing an early and reliable diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases based on a noninvasive clinical examination. © 2017 by ASME.","","Arteries; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Computer Simulation; Humans; Lower Extremity; Models, Cardiovascular; Patient-Specific Modeling; Vascular Stiffness; Blood pressure; Cardiology; Diseases; Inverse problems; Stiffness; Uncertainty analysis; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardio-vascular risk factors; Clinical examination; Hemodynamic modeling; High blood pressures; One-dimensional model; Reduced order models; Uncertainty quantifications; arterial stiffness; Article; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; lower limb; model; pulse pressure; reproducibility; Young modulus; arterial stiffness; artery; biological model; blood flow velocity; blood pressure; computer simulation; lower limb; physiology; vascularization; Diagnosis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84994627558"

We hypothesized that the synergistic resonance of these BP variabilites generates an extraordinarily large dynamic surge in BP and triggers cardiovascular events (the resonance hypothesis). The power of pulses is transmitted to the peripheral sites without attenuation by the large arteries, in individuals with stiffened arteries. Thus, the effect of a BP surge on cardiovascular risk would be especially exaggerated in high-risk patients with vascular disease. Based on this concept, our group recently proposed a new theory of systemic hemodynamic atherothromboltic syndrome (SHATS), a vicious cycle of hemodynamic stress and vascular disease that advances organ damage and triggers cardiovascular disease. Clinical phenotypes of SHATS are large-artery atherothombotic diseases such as stroke, coronary artery disease, and aortic and pheripheral artery disease; small-artery diseases, and microcirculation-related disease such as vascular cognitive dysfunction, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. The careful consideration of BP variability and vascular diseases such as SHATS, and the early detection and management of SHATS, will achieve more effective individualized cardiovascular protection.

Methods: The study was conducted as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, where 145 patients with psoriatic arthritis were supplemented with 3 g of n-3 PUFA or olive oil (control) daily for 24 weeks. Blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability (HRV), central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and fatty acid composition of granulocytes, were determined at baseline and after supplementation. Results: At baseline we found a significant difference in the mean of all normal RR intervals (inverse of heart rate, vary from beat to beat) when comparing subjects with the highest vs the lowest fish intake (p = 0.03). After supplementation for 24 weeks there was a trend towards an increase in RR (p = 0.13) and decrease in heart rate (p = 0.12) comparing the n-3 PUFA group with the control group. However, per-protocol analysis showed significantly increased RR (p = 0.01) and lowered heart rate (p = 0.01) in the n-3 PUFA supplemented patients compared with controls. Blood pressure, PWV and Central blood pressure did not change after supplementation with n-3 PUFA. Adjustment for disease activity and conventional cardiovascular risk factors did not change the results. Conclusions: Marine n-3 PUFA increased RR intervals in patients with psoriatic arthritis which may suggest a protective effect of n-3 PUFA against cardiovascular disease in this population.

The right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) is recognized as a good preload indicator in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Recently, dynamic variation parameters including pleth variability index (PVI) have been used as predictors of fluid responsiveness. However, the correlation between PVI and preload status has not been well studied. We evaluated the relationship between PVI and RVEDVI during liver transplantation. Methods Eighteen patients undergoing liver transplantation were enrolled in this study. Data of hemodynamic parameters including PVI derived by Masimo Rainbow SET Pulse CO-Oximeter, central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (PAOP), and RVEDI were obtained at 10 defined time points throughout liver transplantation. The correlation between RVEDVI and CVP, PAOP, and PVI was analyzed using Spearman rank test. We also investigated the ability of PVI to accurately differentiate RVEDVI <123 or >142 mL/m2 using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results There was fair to good correlation between PVI and RVEDVI (correlation coefficient = -0.492, P <.001). The correlation coefficient between CVP, PAOP, and RVEDVI was 0.345 and 0.463, respectively. A 13.5% cutoff value of PVI estimated the RVEDVI <123 mL/m2 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.762). A 12.5% cutoff value of PVI estimated the RVEDVI >142 mL/m2 (AUC = 0.745). Conclusions PVI presented as a reliable estimate of preload status and may be a useful predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients undergoing liver transplantation. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

A reduction of AIx is known for long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. We hypothesised that acute preload and left ventricular workload effects AIx and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) as a marker of coronary flow reserve. Methods: Increased augmentation index and central blood pressure parameters were measured by radial artery tonometry in 17 healthy men (32/ ± 6 years) at rest and during CPAP ventilation at pressures of 5, 10 mbar and after recovery. In a subset of seven individuals, haemodynamic parameters and autonomic function were additionally examined using combined impedance cardiography and continuous noninvasive blood pressure monitoring. Results: Continuous positive airway pressure reduced heart rate corrected (AIx@75) (-2.8 ± 8.1 [rest] to −10.7 ± 11.3 [5 mbar], p < 0.01, to −12.2 ± 10.5% [10 mbar], p < 0.01) and systolic time integral as a marker of left ventricular workload (2115 ± 231 [rest] to 1978 ± 290 [5 mbar], p = 0.02 to 1940 ± 218 [10 mbar], p < 0.01 to 2013 ± 241 mmHg/s per min [recovery], p = 0.03), while central systolic pressure did not change during CPAP. Total Peripheral Resistance Index increased reaching level of significance at 10 mbar CPAP condition (1701 ± 300 [rest] to 1850 ± 301 dyn*s*m2/cm5 [10 mbar], p = 0.04). There was a reversible increase of SEVR under CPAP conditions. Conclusions: Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation acutely reduces AIx, heart rate and left ventricular workload in healthy young men. These effects seem to be mediated by left ventricular filling pressure, workload and reflection wave. Furthermore, we found an increase of subendocardial viability ratio as an indication for a rising coronary flow reserve by CPAP. © 2017 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)","Augmentation index; Buckberg index; Cardiovascular physiology; CPAP; Systolic time integral; Workload","Adult; Blood Pressure; Continuous Positive Airway Pressure; Coronary Circulation; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Pulse Wave Analysis; Stroke Volume; Systole; Vascular Stiffness; Ventricular Function, Left; adult; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure monitoring; coronary artery blood flow; coronary flow reserve; diastolic blood pressure; heart left ventricle function; heart preload; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; impedance cardiography; male; non invasive procedure; normal human; peripheral arterial tonometry; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; pulse wave; subendocardial viability ratio; systolic blood pressure; vascular resistance; arterial stiffness; blood pressure; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; physiology; positive end expiratory pressure; procedures; systole","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019407023"

We investigated whether baseline perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI), derived from pulse oximetry readings, could predict DEX-induced changes in the hemodynamic status in spontaneously breathing patients. Design Observational study. Setting Operating room. Patients Patients (American Society of Anesthesiologists performance status 1 or 2) scheduled to undergo lower extremity or abdominal procedures under regional anesthesia were approached. Interventions The PI and PVI were set as baseline upon arrival in theater and were then measured at 2.5-minute intervals. Upon attaining stable hemodynamic status under spontaneous breathing, intravenous administration of DEX was initiated at 6 μg kg- 1 h- 1 for 10 minutes, followed by continuous infusion at 0.6 μg kg- 1 h- 1. Measurements Blood pressure, heart rate, PI, and PVI were measured. Hypertension was defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 15% and hypotension as a decrease in SBP < 15% from baseline. Main results Baseline PI and PVI correlated with the degree of change in SBP. The maximum percentage increase as well as the maximum percentage of decrease in SBP from baseline correlated with baseline PI (r = 0.418 [P =.005] and r = 0.507 [P <.001], respectively) and PVI (r = - 0.658 [P <.001] and r = - 0.438 [P =.003], respectively). PVI < 15 identified DEX-induced hypertension (sensitivity 94%, specificity 85%) and PVI > 16 identified DEX-induced hypotension (sensitivity 83%, specificity 64%).

Accurate and real-time cardiac output (CO) monitoring aids clinical decision making during OLT. The purpose of this study is to compare accuracy, precision, and trending ability of CO estimation obtained noninvasively using pulse wave transit time (estimated continuous cardiac output [esCCO; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan]) or thoracic bioimpedance (ICON; Osypka Medical GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to thermodilution cardiac output (TDCO) measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. METHODS: Nineteen patients undergoing OLT were enrolled. CO measurements were collected with esCCO, ICON, and thermodilution at 5 time points: (T1) pulmonary artery catheter insertion; (T2) surgical incision; (T3) portal reperfusion; (T4) hepatic arterial reperfusion; and (T5) abdominal closure. The results were analyzed with Bland-Altman plot, percentage error (the percentage of the difference between the CO estimated with the noninvasive monitoring device and CO measured with the thermodilution technique), 4-quadrant plot with concordance rate (the percentage of the total number of points in the I and III quadrant of the 4-quadrant plot), and concordance correlation coefficient (a measure of how well the pairs of observations deviate from the 45-degree line of perfect agreement). RESULTS: Although TDCO increased at T3-T5, both esCCO and ICON failed to track the changes of CO with sufficient accuracy and precision. The mean bias of esCCO and ICON compared to TDCO were -2.0 L/min (SD, ±2.7 L/min) and -3.3 L/min (SD, ±2.8 L/min), respectively. The percentage error was 69% for esCCO and 77% for ICON. The concordance correlation coefficient was 0.653 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.283-0.853) for esCCO and 0.310 (95% CI, -0.167 to 0.669) for ICON. Nonetheless, esCCO and ICON exhibited reasonable trending ability of TDCO (concordance rate: 95% [95% CI, 88-100] and 100% [95% CI, 93-100]), respectively. The mean bias was correlated with systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and arterial elastance (Ea) for esCCO (SVR, r = 0.610, 95% CI, 0.216-0.833, P <.0001; Ea, r = 0.692, 95% CI, 0.347-0.872; P <.0001) and ICON (SVR, r = 0.573, 95% CI, 0.161-0.815, P <.0001; Ea, r = 0.612, 95% CI, 0.219-0.834, P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The noninvasive CO estimation with esCCO and ICON exhibited limited accuracy and precision, despite with reasonable trending ability, when compared to TDCO, during OLT. The inaccuracy of esCCO and ICON is especially large when SVR and Ea were decreased during the neohepatic phase. Further refinement of the technology is desirable before noninvasive techniques can replace TDCO during OLT. © 2017 International Anesthesia Research Society.","","Aged; Cardiac Output; Electric Impedance; Female; Humans; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Prospective Studies; Pulse Wave Analysis; Thermodilution; adult; arterial pressure; artery compliance; Article; central venous pressure; clinical article; clinical evaluation; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; devices; diastolic arterial pressure; female; heart output; heart output measurement; heart rate; hemodynamic monitoring; human; impedance; liver transplantation; lung artery pressure; male; mean arterial pressure; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; non invasive procedure; priority journal; prospective study; pulse wave; reperfusion; systemic vascular resistance; systolic arterial pressure; thermodilution; time; vasodilatation; aged; comparative study; intraoperative monitoring; liver transplantation; middle aged; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; thermodilution","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85020649873"

Clinicians now recognize that not all PDAs require treatment and that selection of the group of infants with a more hemodynamically relevant PDA, often manifesting as an increasing systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, is increasingly important. Ultrasound is the mainstay of diagnosis and physiological assessment of the PDA; however, there are other methodologies used to assess hemodynamic importance of the PDA. These range from assessment of clinical signs through biomarkers and finally to physiological assessment of the end-organ effect of the PDA, using methods such as cerebral Doppler or near infra-red spectroscopy. Extended assessment of a PDA's physiological effect may lead to a more individualized approach to PDA treatment. © 2018","Hemodynamics; Near-infrared spectroscopy; Neonate; Patent ductus arteriosus; Preterm","Ductus Arteriosus, Patent; Gestational Age; Hemodynamics; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared; Ultrasonography, Doppler; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; carbon monoxide; dobutamine; furosemide; ischemia modified albumin; morphine; steroid; troponin T; assisted ventilation; cardiovascular parameters; chorioamnionitis; clinical assessment; clinical examination; diastolic blood pressure; erythrocyte; genetic predisposition; genetic variability; gestational age; heart hemodynamics; heart murmur; heart perfusion; human; hypotension; inflammation; intrauterine growth retardation; low birth weight; near infrared spectroscopy; patent ductus arteriosus; patient selection; perfusion index; plethysmography; prenatal period; pulse pressure; Review; thorax radiography; thrombocytopenia; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; hemodynamics; newborn; patent ductus arteriosus; pathophysiology; physiology; prematurity","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85046781149"

The aim of this study was to characterize current hospital practices related to the management of low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) across Italy. Methods: We issued a 22-item questionnaire to 14 Italian hospitals performing pediatric cardiac surgery. Results: Electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure, central venous pressure, pulse oximetry, diuresis, body temperature, arterial lactate, and blood gas analysis were identified as routine in hemodynamic monitoring. With regard to advanced hemodynamic monitoring, pulmonary arterial catheter and transpulmonary thermodilution were available in 43% of the centers, uncalibrated pulse contour methods in 29% of the centers, and transesophageal/transthoracic echocardiograms in all of the centers. Dopamine added to milrinone was the most frequent drug regimen for LCOS prevention after cardiopulmonary bypass. Overall, 86% of centers used milrinone alone as the initial treatment for LCOS with elevated systemic vascular resistances and levosimendan, the second preferred choice. In cases of LCOS with low vascular resistance, epinephrine was the first choice (10 centers), dopamine was the second choice (4 centers), followed by vasopressin and norepinephrine (3 centers). For treatment of LCOS with elevated pulmonary resistances, milrinone was the first choice (eight centers), followed by inhaled nitric oxide (five centers). Conclusions: The survey shows that advanced hemodynamic monitoring is rarely performed. The most commonly used vasoactive drugs are milrinone, levosimendan, dopamine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and norepinephrine. Guidelines on the topic are warranted. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","cardiopulmonary bypass; circulatory hemodynamics; congenital heart disease; inflammatory response; intensive care","Cardiotonic Agents; Child; Coronary Care Units; Echocardiography, Transesophageal; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Italy; Male; Monitoring, Physiologic; Postoperative Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; adrenalin; dopamine; lactic acid; levosimendan; milrinone; nitric oxide; noradrenalin; vasoactive agent; vasopressin; cardiotonic agent; artery catheter; Article; blood gas analysis; body temperature; cardiopulmonary bypass; central venous pressure; child; coronary care unit; diuresis; electrocardiography; forward heart failure; health survey; heart surgery; hemodynamic monitoring; human; intensive care unit; Italy; lung resistance; priority journal; pulse oximetry; questionnaire; systemic vascular resistance; thermodilution; transesophageal echocardiography; transthoracic echocardiography; clinical trial; drug effects; female; Heart Defects, Congenital; hemodynamics; male; multicenter study; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; postoperative care; procedures; questionnaire","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84981276150"

This study tested the hypothesis that significant associations are present between height and blood pressure in a representative sample of the US adult population. Participants were 12,988 men and women from a multiethnic sample (age ≥ 18 years) evaluated in the 1999 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who were not taking antihypertensive medications and who had complete height, weight, % body fat, and systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (SBP and DBP) measurements; mean arterial blood pressure and pulse pressure (MBP and PP) were calculated. Multiple regression models for men and women were developed with each blood pressure as dependent variable and height, age, race/ethnicity, body mass index, % body fat, socioeconomic status, activity level, and smoking history as potential independent variables. Greater height was associated with significantly lower SBP and PP, and higher DBP (all P < .001) in combined race/ethnic-sex group models beginning in the 4th decade. Predicted blood pressure differences between people who are short and tall increased thereafter with greater age except for MBP. Socioeconomic status, activity level, and smoking history did not consistently contribute to blood pressure prediction models. Height-associated blood pressure effects were present in US adults who appeared in the 4th decade and increased in magnitude with greater age thereafter. These observations, in the largest and most diverse population sample evaluated to date, provide support for postulated mechanisms linking adult stature with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease risk.

Methods A prospective study was conducted. The patients with septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation (MV) admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of Beijing Electric Power Hospital from January 2016 to December 2017 were enrolled. According to sepsis bundles of septic shock, volume expansion (VE) was conducted. The increase in cardiac index (ΔCI) after VE ≥ 10% was defined as liquid reaction positive (responsive group), ΔCI < 10% was defined as the liquid reaction negative (non-responsive group). The hemodynamic parameters [central venous pressure (CVP), intrathoracic blood volume index (ITBVI), stroke volume variation (SVV), ΔIVC, variability of carotid Doppler peak velocity (ΔCDPV), and variability of brachial artery peak velocity (ΔVpeak-BA)] before and after VE were monitored. The correlations between the hemodynamic parameters and ΔCI were explored by Pearson correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to analyze the predictive value of all hemodynamic parameters on fluid responsiveness. Results During the study, 74 patients with septic shock were included, of whom 9 were excluded because of peripheral artery stenosis, recurrent arrhythmia or abdominal distension influencing the ultrasound examination, and 65 patients were finally enrolled in the analysis. There were 31 patients in the responsive group and 34 in the non-responsive group. SVV, ΔIVC, ΔCDPV and ΔVpeak-BA before VE in responsive group were significantly higher than those of the non-responsive group [SVV: (12.3±2.4)% vs. (9.2±2.1)%, ΔIVC: (22.3±5.3)% vs. (15.5±3.7)%, ΔCDPV: (15.3±3.3)% vs. (10.3±2.4)%, ΔVpeak-BA: (14.5±3.3)% vs. (9.6±2.3)%, all P < 0.05]. There was no significant difference in CVP [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 7.5±2.5 vs. 8.2±2.6] or ITBVI (mL/m2: 875.2±173.2 vs. 853.2±192.0) between the responsive group and non-responsive group (both P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in hemodynamic parameter after VE between the two groups. Correlation analysis showed that SVV, ΔIVC, ΔCDPV, and ΔVpeak-BA before VE showed significant linearity correlation with ΔCI (r value was 0.832, 0.813, 0.854, and 0.814, respectively, all P < 0.05), but no correlation was found between CVP and ΔCI (r = -0.342, P > 0.05) as well as ITBVI and ΔCI (r = -0.338, P > 0.05). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of SVV, ΔIVC, ΔCDPV, and ΔVpeak-BA before VE for predicting fluid responsiveness was 0.857, 0.826, 0.906, and 0.866, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of CVP (AUC = 0.611) and ITBVI (AUC = 0.679). When the optimal cut-off value of SVV for predicting fluid responsiveness was 11.5%, the sensitivity was 70.4%, and the specificity was 94.7%. When the optimal cut-off value of ΔIVC was 20.5%, the sensitivity was 60.3%, and the specificity was 89.7%. When the optimal cut-off value of ΔCDPV was 13.0%, the sensitivity was 75.2%, and the specificity was 94.9%. When the optimal cut-off value of ΔVpeak-BA was 12.7%, the sensitivity was 64.8%, and the specificity was 89.7%. Conclusions Ultrasound assessment of ΔIVC, ΔCDPV, and ΔVpeak-BA could predict fluid responsiveness in patients with septic shock receiving mechanical ventilation. ΔCDPV had the highest predictive value among these parameters.

The aim of this study was to investigate the cardiorespiratory coupling in healthy young individuals genetically predisposed to hypertension at both rest and mental stress conditions. Methods: We studied 39 normotensive male participants [21 with (FH+) and 18 without (FH-) a family history of hypertension]. Electrocardiography, impedance cardiography, beat-to-beat blood pressure and respiratory signal were simultaneously recorded during 5 min of rest and 5 min of mental arithmetic task (MAT). Stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, baroreflex sensitivity and aortic pulse wave velocity were calculated. Autonomic activity was approximated noninvasively by the spectral analysis of cardiovascular variability. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CRPS) were used to define the amplitude and phase relationships of cardiorespiratory coupling. Results: All resting parameters were similar between FH- and FH+ groups except resting CRPS, which was lower in FH+ group. Furthermore, the changes in hemodynamic parameters and cardiovascular variability at MAT were comparable in FH- and FH+ groups. Moreover, MAT elicited a decrease in CRPS of FH- group, whereas CRPS of participants in FH+ group remained unchanged during MAT. Conclusion: Healthy offspring of hypertensive parents have lower CRPS at rest, indicating an early impairment of cardiorespiratory coupling. Furthermore, CRPS decreased under mental stress in participants without a family history of hypertension, whereas this reactivity of CRPS was absent in participants with a family history of hypertension.

However, sinus rhythm (SR) and controlled mechanical ventilation (CV) are mandatory for their application. Several studies suggest a limited applicability of SVV in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We hypothesized that the applicability of SVV might be different over time and within certain subgroups of ICU patients. Therefore, we analysed the prevalence of SR and CV in ICU patients during the first 24 h of PiCCO-monitoring (primary endpoint) and during the total ICU stay. We also investigated the applicability of SVV in the subgroups of patients with sepsis, cirrhosis, and acute pancreatitis. Methods: The prevalence of SR and CV was documented immediately before 1241 thermodilution measurements in 88 patients.Results: In all measurements, SVV was applicable in about 24%. However, the applicability of SVV was time-dependent: the prevalence of both SR and CV was higher during the first 24 h compared to measurements thereafter (36.1% vs. 21.9%; P<0.001). Within different subgroups, the applicability during the first 24 h of monitoring ranged between 0% in acute pancreatitis, 25.5% in liver failure, and 48.9% in patients without pancreatitis, liver failure, pneumonia or sepsis. Conclusions: The applicability of SVV in a predominantly medical ICU is only about 25%–35%. The prevalence of both mandatory criteria decreases over time during the ICU stay. Furthermore, the applicability is particularly low in patients with acute pancreatitis and liver failure. © 2018, Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Fluid responsiveness; Hemodynamic monitoring; Preload; Pulse pressure variation; R44; Stroke volume variation","Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Blood Pressure; Female; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Liver Failure; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pancreatitis; Prospective Studies; Respiration, Artificial; Sepsis; Stroke Volume; acute pancreatitis; adult; Article; artificial ventilation; controlled study; female; fluid responsiveness; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; hospitalization; human; liver cirrhosis; liver failure; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pneumonia; priority journal; prospective study; pulse pressure; sepsis; aged; analysis of variance; blood pressure; fluid therapy; hemodynamics; intensive care unit; liver failure; pancreatitis; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; procedures; sepsis; statistics and numerical data","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85049753679"

The values of HR, SBP, DBP, VIK, SBP time index, DBP time index, SBP variability, DBP variability were obtained in day and night periods. Thus the girls had significantly higher values of daily average HR, day and night HR compared to boys. The boys showed higher SBP values. According to DBP indicators vascular tone in the groups of boys and girls did not differ significantly. Thus, intersexual differences between girls and boys were observed in minute blood volume mechanisms related to heart work. As it turned out, male students had high parasympaticus tonus, especially at night, which corresponds to strengthening of parasympathetic activity. The activity of sympathetic nervous system in young women was significantly higher than in boys in all measurement periods.

In addition, we examined the association between cardiac autonomic activity and central hemodynamic parameters that may affect PPA such as augmentation index (AIx), aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity (PWV)), and common carotid artery stiffness distensibility coefficient (DC). A total of 142 patients with T2DM were included in the study. In multivariate linear regression analysis—after controlling for age, diabetes duration, height, waist circumference, aortic PWV, use of β-blockers, and BRS—PPA was associated significantly and independently with male gender (standardized regression coefficient (β) = 0.156, p = 0.007), aortic systolic blood pressure (β = −0.221, p < 0.001), heart rate (β = 0.521, p < 0.001), AΙx (β = −0.443, p < 0.001), and parameters of HRV, such as total power of HRV (β = −0.157, p = 0.005). No significant associations were found between BRS or parameters of HRV with aortic PWV, AIx, or DC. In patients with T2DM, cardiac autonomic dysfunction was associated with enhanced PPA. This association was independent from the well-described effect of resting heart rate, as well as from traditional cardiovascular risk factors or diabetes-related factors. Moreover, it was not mediated by effects of the autonomic dysfunction on arterial stiffness or on pressure wave reflections.

We compared non-invasive finger arterial pressure-derived continuous cardiac output measurements (Nexfin                             ®                             ) with cardiac output measured using thermodilution during cardiothoracic surgery and determined the impact of cardiovascular variability on either method. We compared cardiac output derived from non-invasive finger arterial pressure with cardiac output measured by thermodilution at four grades (A–D) of cardiovascular variability. We defined Grade A data as heart rate and mean arterial pressure variability < 5% and the absence of arrhythmias (implying stable flow) and Physiocal                             ®                              interval (as measure of variability in finger arterial physiology) > 30 beats. Grade B included all levels of heart rate/mean arterial pressure variability and arrhythmias (Physiocal < 30 excluded). Grade C included all Physiocal intervals (heart rate/mean arterial pressure variability > 5% and arrhythmias excluded). Grade D included all data. Comparison results were quantified as percentage errors. We analysed measurements in 27 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Before extracorporeal circulation, the percentage error was 23% (n = 14 patients) in grade A, 28% (n = 20) in grade B, 32% (n = 22) in grade C and 37% (n = 26) in grade D, with a significant increase in variance (p = 0.035). Bias did not differ between grades. After extracorporeal circulation (n = 27), percentage errors became larger, but were not different between grades. Variability during cardiothoracic surgery affected the comparison between thermodilution and non-invasive finger arterial pressure-derived cardiac output. When the main sources of variability were included, percentage errors were large.

The underlying mechanism of cardiovascular dysfunction often remains unclear. The present study was designed to perform multiparametric assessment of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), arterial stiffness indices, and cardiovascular variabilities (heart rate variability [HRV] and blood pressure variability [BPV]) together in predialytic CKD patients; compare it with normal healthy controls; and determine their relationships in predialytic nondiabetic CKD patients. Thirty CKD Stage 4 and 5 predialytic non-diabetic patients and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. BRS was determined by spontaneous sequence method. Short-term HRV and BPV were assessed using 5 min beat-to-beat data of RR intervals and blood pressure by time domain and frequency domain analysis. Arterial stiffness indices - carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index - were measured using SphygmoCor Vx device (AtCor Medical, Australia). Predialytic CKD patients had significantly low BRS, high PWV, and low HRV as compared to healthy controls. Independent predictors of reduced systolic BRS in predialytic CKD patient group on multiple regression analysis emerged to be increase in calcium-phosphate product, increase in BPV, and decrease in HRV. Predialytic nondiabetic CKD Stage 4 and 5 patients have poor hemodynamic profile (higher PWV, lower HRV, and reduced BRS) than healthy controls. Reduced HRV and altered calcium-phosphate homeostasis emerged to be significant independent predictors of reduced BRS. © 2017 Indian Journal of Nephrology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Baroreflex sensitivity; blood pressure variability; chronic kidney disease; heart rate variability; predialysis; pulse wave velocity","albumin; alkaline phosphatase; calcium phosphate; hemoglobin; urea; uric acid; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; cholesterol blood level; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; dialysis; diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiography; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; heart rate variability; human; male; malnutrition; observational study; pressoreceptor reflex; pulse wave; RR interval; smoking; sphygmomanometry; systolic blood pressure; urea blood level","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034641226"

We aimed to identify metabolic, hemodynamic, and autonomic characteristics associated with raised BP in young adults and whether these differ between males and females. Three thousand one hundred forty-five healthy subjects, aged 18 to 40 years, were grouped according to sex and BP category following the recent reclassification of BP as part of American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2017 guidelines. All individuals undertook a lifestyle and medical history questionnaire and detailed metabolic, hemodynamic, and autonomic assessments. Stage 1 hypertension and normal BP were the most common BP phenotypes in males (29%) and females (68%), respectively. In both sexes, cardiac output was positively associated with increasing BP category (P<0.001 for both). Similar positive trends were observed for heart rate and stroke volume in males (P<0.001 for both) and heart rate in females (P<0.001). Unlike in males, peripheral vascular resistance, aortic pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index were significantly increased in hypertensive females (P<0.001 for all) compared with the other BP categories. Most heart rate variability indices decreased across the BP categories, particularly in males. In young adults, metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities associated with hypertension are already present at the elevated BP stage and the overall phenotype differed markedly between sexes. Whereas a cardiac phenotype was associated with elevated BP and hypertension in males, a vascular phenotype, characterized by elevated peripheral vascular resistance, aortic pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index, was dominant in females. © 2018 The Authors.","Cardiac output; Hypertension; Vascular resistance; Vascular stiffness","Adolescent; Adult; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Pulse Wave Analysis; Sex Characteristics; Stroke Volume; Vascular Resistance; Vascular Stiffness; Young Adult; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure measurement; blood sampling; controlled study; coronary hemodynamics; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; elevated blood pressure; female; follow up; heart output; heart rate; heart rate variability; heart stroke volume; human; hypertension; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; medical history; middle aged; phenotype; practice guideline; priority journal; pulse pressure; pulse wave; questionnaire; sex difference; systolic blood pressure; vascular resistance; young adult; adolescent; blood pressure; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; physiology; sexual characteristics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061589091"

Methods A single-center prospective observation was conducted. The patients on mechanical ventilation with spontaneously breathing admitted to Department of Critical Care Medicine of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University from June 2013 to August 2015 were enrolled. The patients were diagnosed as severe sepsis or sepsis shock. The peak velocity in brachial artery and diameter of the inferior vena cava at the end of inspiration and expiration was measured by bedside portable ultrasonic machine, and then ΔVpeakbrach and VIVC were calculated. The hemodynamic parameters were collected at baseline and after volume expansion (VE). The stroke volume (SV) was measured by pulse-indicated continuous cardiac output (PiCCO). Patients were classified as responders or non-responders according to the variation of SV (ΔSV) increased ≥ 15% or not after VE. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was plotted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of ΔVpeakbrach and VIVC in predicting volume responsiveness. Results Among 58 patients after VE, 32 patients were defined as responders and the rest 26 were defined as non-responders．There were no differences in gender, age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation Ⅱ (APACHE Ⅱ) score, dose of vasoactive agent, ventilator parameters and infection site. Compared with baseline hemodynamic parameters, heart rate (HR) was decreased (bpm: 95±18 vs. 103±21), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was increased [mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 92±8 vs. 80±7] after VE in responders; central venous pressure (CVP) was increased after VE in non-responders (mmHg: 11±4 vs. 8±3, all P < 0.05). The ΔVpeakbrach [(15.4±4.3)% vs. (11.2±3.5)%] and VIVC [(18.6±4.1)% vs. (14.3±3.6)%] in responders were significantly increased as compared with those of non-responders (both P < 0.05). The area under ROC curve (AUC) of ΔVpeakbrach for predicting volume responsiveness was 0.816. When the cut-off value of ΔVpeakbrach was ≥ 13.3%, the sensitivity was 71.9%, and the specificity was 80.8%. AUC of VIVC for predicting volume responsiveness was 0.733. When the cut-off value of VIVC was ≥ 19.25%, the sensitivity was 53.1%, and the specificity was 88.5%. Conclusion ΔVpeakbrach and VIVC are reliable indicators for predicting volume responsiveness in critical patients. © 2018 Heilongjiang Institute of Science and Technology Information.

The present study was aimed to investigate hemodynamic factors that are independently associated with systolic and diastolic BPV from the 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). METHODS A cohort of 624 normotensive and 633 untreated hypertensive participants with baseline ABPM was drawn from a community-based survey. BPV was assessed by the read-to-read average real variability of the 24-hour SBP and DBP (ARVs and ARVd, respectively). Hemodynamic variables including total peripheral resistance (TPR), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cf-PWV), and amplitudes of the decomposed forward (Pf ) and backward (Pb) carotid pressure waves were analyzed. RESULTS In multivariable analyses, hemodynamic variables independently associated with 24-hour SBP were 24-hour heart rate (HR), TPR, cf-PWV, Pf, and Pb (model r2 = 0.535). Hemodynamic factors independently associated with ARV were 24-hour HR, Pf, and Pb for ARVs, and 24-hour HR, cf-PWV, Pf, and Pb for ARVd (model R2 = 0.345 and 0.220, respectively). Addition of 24-hour SBP to the ARV models only slightly improved variance explained by the models (R2 = 0.383 and 0.224, respectively). Pb accounted for >50% of total variance of ARVs and ARVd, whereas cf-PWV was a minor determinant of ARVd (<5% of total variance). CONCLUSIONS ARVd was associated with fewer hemodynamic variables than to 24-hour SBP. Among those hemodynamic variables wave reflection but not arterial stiffness had the dominant independent association with ARV. © American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2016.

Various parameters were measured at baseline and after 3 months using 3 simple non-invasive tests: severity of atherosclerosis [arterial velocity pulse index and arterial pressure volume index (API)] were determined using PASESA®, an autonomic nerve total activity amount index and a coefficient of variation of the R–R interval (CVRR) were determined using eHEART®, and peripheral resistance index, pressure rate product, stroke volume and cardiac index were determined using nico®]. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics including percentages (%) of ischemic heart disease and heart failure between the non-CR and CR groups. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic BP, heart rate and API at baseline significantly decreased and CVRR at baseline significantly increased after 3 months in the CR group, but not in the non-CR group. In addition, ΔAPI (Δ = the value after 3 months minus the value at baseline) was positively associated with ΔSBP in the CR group. In conclusion, CR significantly decreased BP and improved atherosclerosis and sympathetic nerve activity. These findings suggest that simple non-invasive tests may be useful for assessing the effects of CR. © 2016 The Authors","A coefficient of variation of the R–R interval; Arterial pressure volume index; Cardiovascular disease; Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation; Simple non-invasive tests","aged; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; Article; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart index; heart rate variability; heart rehabilitation; hemodynamic parameters; human; male; non invasive procedure; oscillometry; priority journal; prospective study; pulse wave; systolic blood pressure; vascular resistance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84979895773"

Vasopressor support frequently is required after initial volume therapy. Markers of preload dependency have not been studied in this patient group. Dynamic maneuvers such as passive leg raising or end-expiratory hold, which have shown good predictive accuracy in a general intensive care unit population, cannot be considered safe in this cohort because of the concerns of intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated patients with ALF admitted to a tertiary specialist intensive care unit in shock and multiorgan failure were enrolled. Markers of fluid responsiveness derived from transpulmonary thermodilution, pulse contour analysis, and echocardiography were compared between responders (cardiac index ≥15%) and nonresponders to a colloid fluid challenge (5 mL/kg predicted body weight). The ability to predict fluid responsiveness of stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation (PPV), and respiratory change in peak (delta V peak) left ventricular outflow tract velocity for preload dependency were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean ± SD age, 38 [14] years, 13 male, 22 female]) were assessed after a single fluid challenge. Ten patients (29%) were fluid responders. Changes in cardiac index and stroke volume index in the cohort of 35 patients were correlated (R = 0.726 [99% confidence interval, 0.401-0.910]; P <.001). PPV predicted fluid responsiveness (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.752 [95% confidence interval, 0.565-0.889]; P =.005; cutoff >9%). The AUROC for stroke volume variation was 0.678 ([95% confidence interval, 0.499-0.825]; P =.084; cutoff >11%). The AUROC for [delta] V peak before fluid bolus was 0.637 (95% confidence interval, 0.413-0.825; P =.322). CONCLUSIONS: PPV based on pulse contour analysis predicted fluid responsiveness in ALF. © 2016 International Anesthesia Research Society.","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiac Output; Cohort Studies; Critical Care; Female; Fluid Therapy; Humans; Liver Failure, Acute; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Organ Failure; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Respiration, Artificial; Shock; Stroke Volume; Thermodilution; Treatment Outcome; abdominal pressure; acute liver failure; adult; blood pressure variability; central venous pressure; clinical article; cohort analysis; Conference Paper; controlled study; female; fluid responsiveness; heart index; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; male; mean arterial pressure; multiple organ failure; predictive value; priority journal; prospective study; pulse pressure; shock; ventilated patient; aged; artificial ventilation; fluid therapy; heart output; intensive care; Liver Failure, Acute; middle aged; multiple organ failure; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; shock; thermodilution; treatment outcome; very elderly","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85006257486"

The impact of VNS on cardiovascular autonomic function remains to be fully understood. We determined changes in cardiovascular sympathetic and parasympathetic, and hemodynamic function in association with VNS in patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Method Longitudinal (n = 15) evaluation of beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV), baroreflex sensibility, and hemodynamic function performed before VNS implantation, 6-months after implantation, and a mean of 12-months after implantation; and cross-sectional study (n = 14) of BP and HR variability and baroreflex sensitivity during VNS on and VNS off. Results In the longitudinal study, no differences were observed between the baseline, the 6-month visit, and the final visit in markers of parasympathetic cardiovagal tone or baroreflex sensitivity. Systolic and diastolic BP upon 5-min of head-up tilt increased significantly after VNS implantation (Systolic BP: −16.69 ± 5.65 mmHg at baseline, 2.86 ± 16.54 mmHg at 6-month, 12.25 ± 12.95 mmHg at final visit, p = 0.01; diastolic BP: −14.84 ± 24.72 mmHg at baseline, 0.86 ± 16.97 mmHg at 6-month, and 17 ± 12.76 mmHg at final visit, p = 0.001). Conclusion VNS does not seem to produce alterations in parasympathetic cardiovagal tone, regardless of the laterality of the stimulus. We observed a slight increase in sympathetic cardiovascular modulations. These changes had no significant hemodynamic implications. These findings contribute to the understanding of potential mechanisms of action of VNS. © 2016 British Epilepsy Association","Autonomic nervous system; Blood pressure; Heart rate variability; Vagus nerve stimulation","Adult; Autonomic Nervous System; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Statistics, Nonparametric; Vagus Nerve Stimulation; Young Adult; adult; Article; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular function; clinical article; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; drug resistant epilepsy; female; focal epilepsy; heart hemodynamics; heart rate variability; human; implantable pulse generator; implanted vagus nerve stimulator; longitudinal study; male; medical documentation; parasympathetic function; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; sympathetic function; systolic blood pressure; vagus nerve stimulation; autonomic nervous system; blood pressure; drug resistant epilepsy; heart rate; hemodynamics; middle aged; nonparametric test; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; vagus nerve stimulation; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85002342228"

However, no research has been done with isobaric ropivacaine. We, therefore, in this prospective, randomised double-blind study tried to find the optimal dose of intrathecal nalbuphine with isobaric 0.75% ropivacaine for elective lower limb surgeries. Materials and Methods: One hundred American Society of Anaesthesiologists I and II patients undergoing elective lower limb surgery were divided into four groups randomly: groups A, B, C and D, who received 0.5 mL normal saline or 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg nalbuphine made up to 0.5 mL normal saline added to 22.5 mg (total volume 3.5 mL) isobaric 0.75% ropivacaine, respectively. The onset of sensory and motor block, two-segment regression time, duration of sensory and motor block, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the incidence of adverse effects were compared between the groups. Results: The onset of both sensory and motor blockade was faster with addition of 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 mg of nalbuphine when compared with ropivacaine alone; however, it was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Two-segment regression time and duration of analgesia and motor blockade were highest with 1.6 mg of nalbuphine followed by 0.8, 0.4 and plain 0.75% ropivacaine (P < 0.05). The duration of sensory blockade in all four groups was slightly more than the duration of motor blockade. VAS readings were comparable in all nalbuphine groups when compared with ropivacaine group. Haemodynamic variability among the four groups was comparable. Incidence of adverse effects was highest in the 1.6-mg group when compared with others, although it was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Nalbuphine can be a good alternative to other opioids as an adjuvant intrathecally to prolong postoperative analgesia with a minimal side effect profile. Addition of nalbuphine to isobaric 0.75% ropivacaine gives the added advantage of significant analgesia with early motor recovery. We infer from our study that when compared with 1.6 mg of nalbuphine, both 0.4 and 0.8 mg nalbuphine are equally good as adjuvants to isobaric 0.75% ropivacaine in elective lower limb surgeries with prolonged analgesia, a reliable block with equal efficacy but with lesser side effects. © 2018 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia.","Intrathecal nalbuphine; Postoperative analgesia; Ropivacaine","antihistaminic agent; diclofenac; nalbuphine; ondansetron; ropivacaine; adjuvant therapy; adult; analgesia; anesthetic recovery; Article; bradycardia; breathing rate; clinical assessment; diastolic blood pressure; double blind procedure; drug dose comparison; drug effect; elective lower limb surgery; elective surgery; female; hemodynamics; human; hypotension; major clinical study; male; motor system; nausea; neurologic disease; neurologic sequelae; neurologic sequelae; neuromuscular blocking; operation duration; optimal drug dose; oxygen saturation; pain intensity; postoperative analgesia; postoperative pain; prospective study; pruritus; pulse rate; randomized controlled trial; respiration depression; sensorimotor function; sensory system; shivering; spinal anesthesia; supine position; systolic blood pressure; visual analog scale; vomiting","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056276603"

However, the substandard treatment of spinal hypotension and associated complications are responsible for up to two-thirds of deaths that occur in South Africa (SA) for caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia. In some cases, spinal hypotension may be predicted by simple parameters such as age >25 years, preoperative heart rate >90 bpm and preoperative mean arterial pressure <90 mmHg. Heart rate variability and point-of-care echocardiography also predict hypotension with greater accuracy, but are limited by equipment and training issues. Spinal anaesthesia is absolutely contraindicated if the parturient is hypovolaemic. Left lateral tilt is still advised, despite the absence of strong supporting evidence. The dose of spinal bupivacaine should not be reduced in obese patients. Crystalloid co-loading is an adequate fluid strategy in most cases, but is of limited efficacy in the prevention of hypotension. It is imperative that immediately after the patient is placed supine, close attention is paid to communication with her, heart rate changes and pulse volume. Early intervention with phenylephrine is the first-line approach for hypotension if heart rate is preserved under spinal anaesthesia. Phenylephrine infusions (25-50 µg/min) are easy to administer, maintain baseline maternal haemodynamics and are applicable to the SA context. The vigilant use of phenylephrine boluses (50-100 µg), targeting maternal heart rate as a surrogate for cardiac output, is also effective. Noradrenaline has been used successfully to prevent spinal hypotension, but evidence does not yet suggest practice change.

Patients with CF-VADs often do not have a palpable pulse, and therefore traditional blood pressure measurement by auscultation or automated cuff is less reliable. We tested the efficacy of blood pressure estimation using sphygmomanometry combined with finger pulse oximetry only after a hemodynamic optimization was effected to make the values estimated approximately similar to mean arterial pressure. Methods: Fifteen consecutive patients with a mean age of 57.8 ± 11.2 years were implanted with HeartMate 3 between November 2015 and March 2017. All patients underwent pump speed optimization by conducting a ramp test during right heart catheterization. The patients were prospectively studied during the follow-up period and mean arterial pressure was estimated using 3 different methodologies: Doppler ultrasound, pulse oximeter, and automated blood pressure cuff. For each method 3 consecutive evaluations were conducted during 3 follow-up visits. Results: For each patient, 9 different evaluations were obtained (3 for each method). The overall success rate was 100% for blood pressure assessment conducted with Doppler ultrasound and pulse oximeter and 80%-87% for automated monitor evaluations. The first 2 methodologies were 100% successful, while the third was 60% successful. Pearson's correlation analyses for the Doppler ultrasound and pulse oximeter measurements showed a good correlation when evaluations conducted with the same method were compared. A high variability emerged between estimations obtained by using an automated monitor and a poor correlation was found when this method was compared to the Doppler ultrasound and pulse oximeter measurements. Conclusion: According to our results, the pulse oximeter method showed a high success rate and a good correlation level with the standard procedure. Our data encourage the use of oximeters for domiciliary blood pressure assessment in patients implanted with a continuous flow device. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","","Adult; Aged; Blood Pressure Determination; Female; Heart-Assist Devices; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Oximetry; Sphygmomanometers; Ultrasonography, Doppler; adult; Article; automation; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; correlational study; Doppler flowmetry; female; follow up; heart catheterization; heart right ventricle failure; hemodynamic parameters; human; male; mean arterial pressure; middle aged; priority journal; prospective study; pulse oximetry; sphygmomanometry; aged; Doppler ultrasonography; heart assist device; oximetry; physiologic monitoring; procedures; sphygmomanometer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059857250"

A significant percentage of patients have different blood pressure readings when examined in the office or outside it. For this reason, a change in the paradigm of the best manner to assess blood pressure has been observed. The method that has been most widely used is the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring – ABPM. The method allows recording blood pressure measures in 24 hours and evaluating various parameters such as mean BP, pressure loads, areas under the curve, variations between daytime and nighttime, pulse pressure variability etc. Blood pressure measurements obtained by ABPM are better correlated, for example, with the risks of hypertension. The main indications for ABPM are: suspected white coat hypertension and masked hypertension, evaluation of the efficacy of the antihypertensive therapy in 24 hours, and evaluation of symptoms. There is increasing evidence that the use of ABPM has contributed to the assessment of blood pressure behaviors, establishment of diagnoses, prognosis and the efficacy of antihypertensive therapy. There is no doubt that the study of 24-hour blood pressure behavior and its variations by ABPM has brought more light and less darkness to the field, which justifies the title of this review. © 2016, Arquivos Brasileiros de Cardiologia.

PWV is usually calculated by measuring the pulse transit time (PTT) over a known distance through the arteries. In an experimental study on animals, it is straight forward to measure the PTT using two pressure catheters a known distance apart in the central arteries. However, in a clinical setting it is uncommon for such a direct invasive method to be used. This study aims to identify whether a surrogate measure of PTT could be found without the need for an external device and without being additionally invasive. The aim is to use the time between the R-wave of an electrocardiogram (ECG), and the pulse wave passing one pressure catheter (rPTT), both of which are common in critical care. The analysis was performed using data from four porcine experiments (Pietrain Pigs, 20-29kg) in which ECG, aortic arch pressure and abdominal aortic pressure were measured simultaneously over a range of induced hemodynamic conditions including recruitment manoeuvres (RM), fluid admission and dobutamine admission. From the measured data, the correlation of rPTT and PTT was calculated for each pig and condition. The overall results showed varied correlations across the pigs (r2 = 0.07 to 0.75). The variability is suspected to be due to two main causes, the first being pig specific response to the interventions. The second cause leading to poor correlation is suspected to be the pre-ejection period (PEP), the time following the ECG R-wave but before ejection of blood from the ventricle. The analysis showed that rPTT was an unreliable measure of PTT and a poor surrogate. © 2017","Bio-signals analysis; Biomedical systems; Cardiovascular; Electrocardiogram; interpretation; Pre-ejection Period; Pulse transit time; Pulse wave velocity","Acoustic wave velocity; Blood vessels; Catheters; Mammals; Wave propagation; Biomedical systems; Biosignals; Cardiovascular; interpretation; Pre-ejection Period; Pulse transit time; Pulse wave velocity; Electrocardiography","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85031804727"

Male C57BL6J mice fed with a high-fat (HFD) or a high-fat high-sucrose (HFHSu), or a regular chow diet (C) for 8 weeks were evaluated for metabolic parameters and blood pressure, the latter being performed in conscious freely moving mice. Spectral analysis from the records of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiac pulse intervals (PI) was performed to analyse the autonomic balance in the cardiovascular system. HFD-fed mice developed two distinct hemodynamic phenotypes: hypertensive mice (HFD-H) with high systolic and diastolic BP levels and hypertension-resistant mice (HFD-R) whose BP levels were similar to C group. Spectral analysis of SBP and PI variabilities indicate that the low-frequency (LF)/high-frequency (HF) ratio, which is an index of sympathovagal balance, is higher in HFD-H compared to HFD-R. Along with hypertension and higher LF/HF ratio, HFD-H mice presented increased hypothalamic mRNA levels of cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART), and increased CART-positive neurones in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) by high-fat diet when compared to C group. Despite developing obesity to similar levels than HFD feeding, intake of a HFHSu was not associated with hypertension in mice neither CART levels increase. Collectively, our main findings indicate that high-fat diet induced-hypertension and autonomic imbalance are associated to an upregulation of CART levels in the DMH of mice. © 2016 The Authors.

ANIMALS 6 healthy male Landrace pigs. PROCEDURES Pigs were anesthetized with isoflurane, positioned in dorsal recumbency, and instrumented. Following induction of a neuromuscular blockade, pigs were mechanically ventilated throughout 5 sequential experimental stages during which the blood volume was manipulated so that subjects transitioned from normovolemia (baseline) to hypovolemia (blood volume depletion, 20% and 40%), back to normovolemia, and then to hypervolemia. During each stage, hemodynamic variables were measured before and 3 minutes after a PLRM and 1 minute after the pelvic limbs were returned to their original position. The PLRM consisted of raising the pelvic limbs and caudal portion of the abdomen to a 15° angle relative to the horizontal plane. RESULTS Hemodynamic variables did not vary in response to the PLRM when pigs were normovolemic or hypervolemic. When pigs were hypovolemic, the PLRM resulted in a significant increase in cardiac output and decrease in plethysomographic variability index and pulse pressure variation. When the pelvic limbs were returned to their original position, cardiac output and pulse pressure variation rapidly returned to their pre-PLRM values, but the plethysomographic variability index did not. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested a modified PLRM might be useful for identification of hemodynamically unstable animals that are likely to respond to fluid therapy. Further research is necessary to validate the described PLRM for prediction of fluid responsiveness in clinically ill animals. © 2019, American Veterinary Medical Association.

However, respiratory intrathoracic pressure changes during spontaneous breathing are considered too small to affect preload and stroke volume sufficiently for the detection by PPV and/or SPV. This study addressed the effects of paced breathing and/or an external respiratory resistance on PPV and SPV in detecting preload dependency in spontaneously breathing subjects. Methods: In 10 healthy subjects, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters were evaluated during progressive central hypovolemia (head-up tilt). Breathing conditions were varied by manipulating breathing frequency and respiratory resistance. Subjects responding with a reduction in stroke volume index >15% were classified as having developed preload dependency. The ability for PPV and SPV to predict preload dependency was expressed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: A breathing frequency at 6/min increased the PPV (16±5% vs. 10±3%, p<0.001) and SPV (9±3% vs. 5±2%, p<0.001) which was further enhanced by an expiratory resistance (PPV: 19±3%, p = 0.025 and SPV: 10±2%, p = 0.047). These respiratory modifications, compared to free breathing, enhanced the predictive value of PPV with higher accuracy (AUC: 0.92 vs. 0.46). Conclusion: Under conditions of progressive central hypovolemia, the application of an external respiratory resistance at a breathing frequency of 6/min enhanced PPV and SPV and is worth further study for detection of preload dependency from arterial pressure variations in nonventilated subjects.

It is usually calculated by measuring the pulse transit time (PTT) over a known distance through the arteries. In animal studies, reliable PTT measures can be obtained using two pressure catheters. However, such direct, invasive methods are undesirable in clinical settings. A less invasive alternative measure of PTT is pulse arrival time (PAT), the time between the Q-wave of an electrocardiogram (ECG) and the arrival of the foot of the beats pressure waveform at one pressure catheter. Since the Q-wave signifies the start of ventricular contraction, PAT includes the pre-ejection period (PEP), a time where no blood is ejected. Thus, inter- or intra- subject variation in PEP could result in poor correlation between pulse arrival time (PAT) and the desired pulse transit time (PTT). Approach: This study looks at the relationship between PAT and PTT, over a range of common critical care therapies and determines the effect of PEP on PAT as a possible surrogate of PTT in a critical care environment. The analysis uses data from five porcine experiments, where ECG, aortic arch and abdominal aortic pressure were measured simultaneously, over a range of induced hemodynamic conditions. Results: The resulting correlations of PAT verse PTT varied within pigs and across interventions (r 2 = 0.32-0.69), and across pigs (r 2 = 0.05-0.60). Variability was due to three main causes. First, the interventions themselves effect PEP and PTT differently, second, pig specific response to the interventions, and third, inter- and intra- pig variability in PEP, independent of PTT. Significance: The overall analysis shows PAT is an unreliable measure of PTT and a poor surrogate under clinical interventions common in a critical care setting, due to intra- and inter- subject variability in PEP. © 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","compliance; electrocardiogram; pre-ejection period; pulse transit time; pulse wave velocity","Animals; Aorta; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electrocardiography; Hemodynamics; Pulse Wave Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sus scrofa; Blood vessels; Catheters; Electrocardiography; Mammals; Wave propagation; Arterial stiffness; Cardiovascular dysfunction; Compliance; Critical care; Pre-ejection period; Pulse arrival time; Pulse transit time; Pulse-wave; Pulse-wave velocity; Q waves; animal; aorta; cardiovascular disease; electrocardiography; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; physiology; pig; procedures; pulse wave; reproducibility; Acoustic wave velocity","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054764612"

Haemodynamics were recorded during passive 10-minute head-up tilt using radial pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography, and spectral analysis of heart rate variability. Thirty age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Liquorice ingestion elevated radial systolic (p < 0.001) and diastolic (p = 0.018) blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance (p = 0.037). During orthostatic challenge, heart rate increased less after the liquorice versus control diet (p = 0.003) and low frequency power of heart rate variability decreased within the liquorice group (p = 0.034). Liquorice intake increased central pulse pressure (p < 0.001) and augmentation index (p = 0.002) supine and upright, but in the upright position the elevation of augmentation index was accentuated (p = 0.007). Liquorice diet also increased extracellular fluid volume (p = 0.024) and aortic to popliteal pulse wave velocity (p = 0.027), and aortic characteristic impedance in the upright position (p = 0.002). To conclude, in addition to increased extracellular fluid volume and large arterial stiffness, two weeks of liquorice ingestion elevated systemic vascular resistance and augmentation index. Measurements performed at rest may underestimate the haemodynamic effects of liquorice ingestion, as enhanced central wave reflection and reduced chronotropic response were especially observed in the upright position. © 2017 The Author(s).","","Adult; Aorta; Arterial Pressure; Extracellular Fluid; Female; Glycyrrhiza; Glycyrrhizic Acid; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Plant Extracts; Posture; Vascular Resistance; Vascular Stiffness; glycyrrhizic acid; plant extract; adult; aorta; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; body position; chemistry; clinical trial; drug effect; extracellular fluid; female; Glycyrrhiza; heart rate; human; male; middle aged; physiology; vascular resistance","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85028966597"

The purpose of this study is to characterize age-related alterations in beat-to-beat oscillations in arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), cerebral blood flow (CBF), cardiac baroreflex sensitivity, and dynamic cerebral autoregulation across the adult life span. We studied 136 healthy adults aged 21 to 80 years (60% women). Beat-to-beat BP, HR, and CBF velocity were measured at rest and during sit-stand maneuvers to mimic effects of postural changes on BP and CBF. Transfer function analysis was used to assess baroreflex sensitivity and dynamic cerebral autoregulation. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was measured to assess central arterial stiffness. Advanced aging was associated with elevated carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, systolic and pulse BP, cerebrovascular resistance, and CBF pulsatility, but reduced mean CBF velocity. Compared with the young and middle-aged, older adults had lower beat-to-beat BP, HR, and CBF variability in the low-frequency ranges at rest, but higher BP and CBF variability during sit-stand maneuvers. Baroreflex sensitivity was reduced, whereas dynamic cerebral autoregulation gain was elevated at rest in older adults. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that systolic BP variability is correlated positively with carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity independent of HR variability. In conclusion, advanced aging is associated with elevated pulsatility in BP and CBF; reduced beat-to-beat low-frequency oscillations in BP, HR, and CBF; and impaired baroreflex sensitivity and dynamic cerebral autoregulation at rest. The augmented BP and CBF variability in older adults during sit-stand maneuvers indicate diminished cardiovascular regulatory capability and increased hemodynamic stress on the cerebral circulation with aging. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.","aging; blood pressure; cerebrovascular circulation; heart rate; hemodynamics","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Arterial Pressure; Baroreflex; Blood Flow Velocity; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Circadian Rhythm; Electrocardiography; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Rate; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial; Vascular Stiffness; Young Adult; adult; aged; arterial pressure; Article; body mass; brain blood flow; cardiac baroreflex; cardiovascular autoregulation; carotid artery pulse; controlled study; female; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; lifespan; normal human; oscillation; pressoreceptor reflex; priority journal; pulse wave; steady state; age; aging; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; blood flow velocity; brain circulation; circadian rhythm; electrocardiography; heart rate; homeostasis; hypertension; male; middle aged; physiology; sex difference; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; very elderly; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85012888884"

Coarse PM substantially contributes to global air pollution, yet differs in characteristics from fine particles and is currently not regulated. However, the cardiovascular (CV) impacts of coarse PM exposure remain largely unknown. Objectives: Our goal was to elucidate whether coarse PM, like fine PM, is itself capable of eliciting adverse CV responses. Methods: We performed a randomized double-blind crossover study in which 32 healthy adults (25.9 ± 6.6 years of age) were exposed to concentrated ambient coarse particles (CAP; 76.2 ± 51.5 μg/m3) in a rural location and filtered air (FA) for 2 hr. We measured CV outcomes during, immediately after, and 2 hr postexposures. Results: Both systolic (mean difference = 0.32 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.58; p = 0.021) and diastolic BP (0.27 mmHg; 95% CI: 0.003, 0.53; p = 0.05) linearly increased per 10 min of exposure during the inhalation of coarse CAP when compared with changes during FA exposure. Heart rate was on average higher (4.1 bpm; 95% CI: 3.06, 5.12; p < 0.0001) and the ratio of low-to-high frequency heart rate variability increased (0.24; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.41; p = 0.007) during coarse particle versus FA exposure. Other outcomes (brachial flow-mediated dilatation, microvascular reactive hyperemia index, aortic hemodynamics, pulse wave velocity) were not differentially altered by the exposures. Conclusions: Inhalation of coarse PM from a rural location is associated with a rapid elevation in BP and heart rate during exposure, likely due to the triggering of autonomic imbalance. These findings add mechanistic evidence supporting the biological plausibility that coarse particles could contribute to the triggering of acute CV events.","","Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Physiological Processes; Cross-Over Studies; Double-Blind Method; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Young Adult; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; air pollutant; particulate matter; adult; air pollution; artery diameter; article; autonomic imbalance; autonomic neuropathy; brachial artery diameter; cardiovascular effect; diastolic blood pressure; female; filtered air; heart hemodynamics; heart rate; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; hyperemia; male; normal human; particulate matter; priority journal; pulse wave; randomized controlled trial; rural area; systolic blood pressure; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution; blood pressure; cardiovascular function; controlled study; crossover procedure; double blind procedure; drug effects; exposure; middle aged; particle size; particulate matter; rural population; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901788122"

Traditional vital sign parameters allow no optimal triage. High predictive power of finger plethysmography-based stroke volume (SV) and pulse pressure (PP) was recently suggested. To assess the performance of the PP and SV parameters, lower body negative pressure of -40 mmHg, than -60 mmHg - corresponding to moderate and severe central hypovolemia - was applied in 22 healthy males (age 35 ± 7 years). Slow breathing induced fluctuations in the above indices, characterized by stroke volume variability (SVV), and pulse pressure variability (PPV), were assessed. Responses in heart rate (HR) and shock index (SI) were also studied. Discriminative capacity of these parameters was characterized by the area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves (AUC). Results: In comparison of baseline to severe central hypovolemia SV, PP, HR and SI showed good discriminating capacity (AUC 99%, 88%, 87% and 93%, respectively). The discriminating capacity of SVV and PPV was poor (77% and 70%, respectively). In comparison of moderate and severe hypovolemia, the discriminating capacity of the studied parameters was uniformly limited. Conclusions: Plethysmography-based SV and PP parameters can be used to detect acute severe volume loss. Sensitive parameters discriminating moderate and severe central hypovolemia are still lacking. © 2015 Akadémiai Kiadó.","Central hypovolemia; Noninvasive finger blood pressure monitoring; Pulse pressure; Stroke volume","Acute Disease; Adult; Area Under Curve; Arterial Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Humans; Hypovolemia; Male; Middle Aged; Photoplethysmography; Pulse Wave Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult; acute disease; adult; arterial pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; blood pressure monitoring; clinical assessment; comparative study; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; faintness; heart hemodynamics; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; human experiment; hypovolemia; lower body negative pressure; male; mean arterial pressure; non invasive procedure; normal human; plethysmography; positive end expiratory pressure; presyncope; pulse pressure; pulse pressure variability; severe central hypovolemia; shock; stroke volume variability; acute disease; area under the curve; arterial pressure; blood pressure measurement; clinical trial; hypovolemia; middle aged; pathophysiology; photoelectric plethysmography; procedures; pulse wave; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926394611"

One of the most important risk factor after carotid reconstructions of acute myocardial infarction, hyperperfusion syndrome, postoperative hematomas is arterial hypertension. Aim: To investigate the influence of carotid sinus nerves damage on postoperative arterial hypertension after carotid reconstructions and to compare clinical results with data of rhythmocardiography. Material and methods: The retrospective analyze of treatment of 310 patients have done. The patients were divided into two groups. The first group included 177 patients with intersected carotid sinus nerves. The second group included 133 patients with preserved carotid sinus nerves. The second part of our study was a prospective evaluation of peripheral autonomic regulation of 13 patients from first group and 17 patients from second group by high-precision analysis of heart rate variability. Results. On the first postoperative day in the group where the carotid sinus nerves were kept all the blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, pulse pressure), and heart rate were significantly lower than in the other group (p>0.05), with a tendency to restore on the 3rd day. This reduced number of postoperative complications. In patients with preserved carotid sinus nerves by rhythmocardiography marked lower sympathetic activity and higher activity of the parasympathetic system. Conclusion. The implementation of glomus-preserving operations on the carotid arteries reduces the risk of postoperative hypertension and complications of early postoperative period.","Carotid Endarterectomy; Carotid Sinus Nerves; Hypertension; Rhythmocardiography","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85009834025"

Mechanical ventilation induces cyclic variations in blood pressure, e.g. pulse pressure variation, whose magnitude predicts fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients. In this study, we hypothesised that a deep breathing manoeuvre with its effect on heart rate variability (HRV) could induce similar cyclic variations in blood pressure in spontaneously breathing healthy subjects and that the magnitude of these variations could predict the hemodynamic response to controlled haemorrhage. 37 blood donors were instructed to perform two simple deep breathing manoeuvres prior to blood donation; one manoeuvre with a respiratory cycle every 10 s (0.1 Hz) and one every 6 s (0.167 Hz). The variation in the pre-ejection period (ΔPEP) was captured with the electrocardiographic and plethysmographic curves, while the hemodynamic response to haemorrhage was estimated with the cardiac output change assessed with ultrasonography. Respiratory HRV was estimated with root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Deep breathing induced cyclic changes in ΔPEP magnitude was significantly correlated to RMSSD (p < 0.005). ΔPEP indexed to RMSSD increased significantly following haemorrhage at the 0.167 Hz respiratory frequency (p = 0.01). At none of the respiratory manoeuvres was ΔPEP nor ΔPEP/RMSSD prior to haemorrhage correlated to changes in cardiac output following haemorrhage. Deep breathing induces cyclic changes in blood pressure that are strongly dependent on HRV. These blood pressure variations do, however, not predict the cardiac output response to controlled haemorrhage. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media.","Cardiac output; Fluid responsiveness; Frank-Starling curve; Hemodynamic monitoring; Preload; Stroke volume","Adult; Blood Donors; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Female; Heart Rate; Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Respiratory Mechanics; Respiratory Rate; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stroke Volume; Young Adult; Blood pressure; Forecasting; Patient monitoring; Ventilation; Cardiac output; Fluid responsiveness; Frank-Starling curve; Hemodynamic monitoring; Pre loads; Stroke volumes; adult; article; bleeding; blood donor; blood pressure; breathing pattern; clinical evaluation; correlation analysis; echography; electrocardiography; female; heart output; heart preejection period; heart rate variability; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; hyperpnea; male; normal human; plethysmography; predictive value; priority journal; root mean square of successive difference; Hemodynamics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901664828"

The purpose of this study was to compare the discriminative ability of the following three measures to predict the onset of hemodynamic decompensation: peripheral perfusion index (PPI), pulse pressure variability (PPV), and the compensatory reserve index (CRI). Materials and Methods: There were 51 healthy participants who underwent a progressive simulated hemorrhage to induce central hypovolemia by lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The leastsquares means and 95% confidence intervals for each measure were reported by LBNP level and stratified by tolerance status (high tolerance vs. low tolerance). Generalized estimating equations were used to performrepeated measures logistic regression analysis by regressing the onset of hemodynamic decompensation on each of the vital signs of interest. These probabilities were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, and receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve (ROCAUC) for PPI, PPV, and CRI. Results: Compared with both PPV (ROCAUC=0.79) and PPI (0.56), the CRI (0.90) had superior discriminative ability (P≤0.0001) to predict the onset of hemodynamic decompensation. This included higher sensitivity (0.86 vs. 0.78 and 0.71) and specificity (0.78 vs. 0.69 and 0.29) for the CRI compared with PPV and PPI, respectively. Further, CRI was the only measure with mean predicted probabilities of the onset of hemodynamic decompensation that progressively increased as the level of simulated hemorrhage increased. Discussion: There are two potential rationales for why the CRI had superior discriminative ability to predict hemodynamic decompensation. First, the CRI more accurately predicted the onset of hemodynamic decompensation at all levels of simulated hemorrhage, but especially at lower levels of hemorrhage. Second, the CRI was better able to differentiate high versus low tolerant participants. Conclusion: Consistent with previous research, the CRI had superior discriminative ability to predict the onset of hemodynamic decompensation. For those patients at greatest risk for developing impending circulatory shock, identifying the most sensitive and specific measures of the onset of hemodynamic decompensation is critical for both the early recognition and implementation of life-saving interventions. © 2015 by the Shock Society.","Hemorrhage; Hypovolemia; Physiologic monitoring; Shock","Adult; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure; Blood Volume; Cardiology; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Hemorrhage; Humans; Hypovolemia; Least-Squares Analysis; Lower Body Negative Pressure; Male; Perfusion; Probability; Shock; Stroke Volume; Young Adult; adult; Article; bleeding; blood volume; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; decompression; disease simulation; female; hemodynamic decompensation; hemodynamic monitoring; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; hypovolemia; hypovolemic shock; lower body negative pressure; male; normal human; peripheral perfusion index; pulse pressure; pulse pressure variability; variability compensatory reserve index; vasoconstriction; vital sign; area under the curve; blood pressure; cardiology; comparative study; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamics; Hemorrhage; hypovolemia; least square analysis; perfusion; physiology; probability; procedures; shock; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947867600"

An improved approach to identification of fluid responsiveness is of clinical importance. Currently fluid responsiveness is most frequently identified by blood pressure (BP) measurements or a surrogate. However fluid responsiveness is simply the increase in stroke volume (SV) associated with volume expansion, and may not be reflected in BP or BP surrogates. Guyton demonstrated that BP = CO x SVR, and it is know that baroreceptor mediated autonomic nervous system regulation of SV and SVR to preserve BP may mask significant and critical changes in haemodynamics. Dr Pinsky in his recent J Clin Monit Comput Editorial evaluated the relative merits of pulse pressure variability (PPV) methods, a variant on BP measurement, for assessment of fluid responsiveness and promoted the use of physiologic challenges to augment the applicability of PPV. However this guidance is only half right. This letter reminds clinicians of the physiologic limitations of PPV as a measure of fluid responsiveness, even when combined with physiologic challenges, and recommends the replacement of BP with SV measurements. The combination of accurate Doppler measurement of SV and physiologic challenges, as Dr Pinsky recommends, is a physiologically rational and effective approach to identification of fluid responsiveness with established evidence. The direct monitoring of SV and SV changes has the potential to improve a long standing critical care and anaesthetic conundrum; when to give fluid and when to stop. © 2014, The Author(s).","Advanced haemodynamics; Blood pressure; Doppler; Fluid responsiveness; Monitoring; PPV","Blood Pressure; Echocardiography, Doppler; Fluid Therapy; Heart Failure; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Monitoring, Physiologic; Reproducibility of Results; Sepsis; Stroke Volume; Blood pressure; Hemodynamics; Monitoring; Autonomic nervous system; Cardiovascular monitoring; Direct monitoring; Doppler; Doppler measurement; Effective approaches; Fluid responsiveness; Haemodynamics; blood pressure; Doppler echocardiography; fluid therapy; heart failure; heart stroke volume; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; sepsis; Blood","Letter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922338062"

We aimed to compare different haemodynamic treatments in liver surgery. In a prospective, blinded, randomised, controlled pilot trial patients undergoing liver resection were randomised to receive haemodynamic management guided by conventional haemodynamic parameters or by oesophageal Doppler monitor (ODM, CardioQ-ODM) or by pulse power wave analysis (PPA, LiDCOrapid) within a goal-directed algorithm adapted for liver surgery. The primary endpoint was stroke volume index before intra-operative start of liver resection. Secondary endpoints were the haemodynamic course during surgery and postoperative pain levels. Due to an unbalance in the extension of the surgical procedures with a high rate of only minor procedures the conventional group was dropped from the analysis. Eleven patients in the ODM group and 10 patients in the PPA group were eligible for statistical analysis. Stroke volume index before start of liver resection was 49 (37; 53) ml/m2 and 48 (41; 56) ml/m2 in the ODM and PPA group, respectively (p=0.397). The ODM guided group was haemodynamically stable as shown by ODM and PPA measurements. However, the PPA guided group showed a significant increase of pulse-pressure-variability (p=0.002) that was not accompanied by a decline of stroke volume index displayed by the PPA (p=0.556) but indicated by a decline of stroke volume index by the ODM (p<0.001). The PPA group had significantly higher postoperative pain levels than the ODM group (p=0.036).

The aim of this study was to validate the ability of SVV, PPV and PVI to predict intraoperative FR in mechanically ventilated patients with obstructive jaundice (OJ). Thirty-two patients with OJ (mean serum total bilirubin 190.5 ± 95.3 μmol L-1) received intraoperative volume expansion (VE) with 250 ml colloids immediately after an exploratory laparotomy had been completed and after a 5 min period of hemodynamic stability. Hemodynamic variables were recorded before and after VE. FR was defined as an increase in stroke volume index > 10% after VE. The ability of SVV, PPV and PVI to predict FR was assessed by calculation of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Eleven (34%) patients were responders and 21 patients were nonresponders to VE. The PPV was the unique dynamic index that had the moderate ability to predict FR during surgical procedures, the area under the curve was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.523 to 0.856; P = 0.039) and the threshold (sensitivity and specificity) discriminated responders was 7.5% (63.6%/71.4%). The present study concluded that SVV and PVI were not reliable predictors of FR, but PPV has some value predicting FR in patients with OJ intraoperatively. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","dynamic indices; fluid responsiveness; intraoperative; obstructive jaundice; pleth variability index; pulse pressure variation; stroke volume variation","Bilirubin; Blood Pressure; Colloids; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Intraoperative Care; Jaundice, Obstructive; Laparotomy; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Ventilation; ROC Curve; Stroke Volume; Surgery; bilirubin; Dynamic indices; Fluid responsiveness; Haemodynamics; Intra-operative; Obstructive jaundice; Pleth variability index; Pulse-pressure variations; Stroke volume variations; Variability index; Volume expansion; article; blood; blood pressure; colloid; female; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamics; human; laparotomy; lung ventilation; male; middle aged; obstructive jaundice; pathophysiology; peroperative care; physiology; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897536014"

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of combined administration of landiolol and Catecholamine on regulation of heart rate in tachycardia after cardiopulmonary bypass. Design: The study was performed as a prospective controlled trial. Setting: A university hospital. Participants: The subjects were 30 of 64 patients with heart rate >115 bpm after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Interventions: Fifteen of the patients (the landiolol group) were administered landiolol at a dose of 3-5/ig/kg/min without a decrease in the dose of Catecholamine. The other 15 patients (the control group) did not receive landiolol, but the Catecholamine dose of 1/μg/kg/min was decreased to reduce the heart rate. Results: Mean arterial pressure, cardiac index and heart rate were measured 5, 10 and 15 min after drug administration and postoperatively. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index were unchanged after drug administration, but heart rate was significantly lower after 15 min and postoperatively in patients administered landiolol compared with those who did not receive landiolol. Conclusions: Combined administration of landiolol and Catecholamine is useful for stabilization of cardiovascular changes after cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.","Cardiac index; Cardiopulmonary bypass; Catecholamine; Heart rate; Landiolol","catecholamine; dobutamine; dopamine; fentanyl; landiolol; midazolam; pancuronium; vecuronium; adult; aged; article; bradycardia; cardiopulmonary bypass; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; electrocardiogram; female; heart contraction; heart index; heart rate variability; human; hypotension; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; oxygen saturation; prospective study; pulse oximetry; tachycardia","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901981820"

Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. Eighty-seven patients suffering from septic shock undergoing mechanical ventilation in Department of Critical Care Medicine of Subei People's Hospital from June 2012 to September 2014 were enrolled. The hemodynamic changes before and after PLR were monitored by pulse indicated continuous cardiac output (PiCCO) and PVI monitoring. Responsive group: positive fluid response was defined as an increase in cardiac index (CI) ≥ 10% after PLR. Unresponsive group: negative fluid response was defined as an increase in CI < 10% after PLR. The hemodynamic parameters, including heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), stroke volume variation (SVV), CI and PVI, and the changes in cardiac parameters (ΔHR, ΔMAP, ΔCVP, Δ SVV, Δ CI, and Δ PVI) before and after PLR were determined. The relations between hemodynamic parameters and their changes with Δ CI were analyzed by the Pearson analysis. The role of the parameters for volume responsiveness prediction was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: 145 PLRs in 87 patients with septic shock were conducted, with 67 in responsive group and 78 in unresponsive group. There were no statistically significant differences in HR, MAP, CVP and CI before PLR between the responsive and unresponsive groups. SVV and PVI in responsive group were significantly higher than those in the unresponsive group [SVV: (16.9 ± 3.1)% vs. (8.4 ± 2.2) %, t = 9.078, P = 0.031; PVI: (20.6 ± 4.3)% vs. (11.1 ±3.2)%, t = 19.189, P = 0.022]. There were no statistically significant differences in HR, MAP, CVP, SVV, and PVI after PLR between the responsive group and unresponsive group. CI in the responsive group was significantly higher than that in the unresponsive group (mL·s-1m-2: 78.3±6.7 vs. 60.0 ± 8.3, t = 2.902, P = 0.025). There were no statistically significant differences in Δ HR, Δ MAP, Δ CVP between responsive group and unresponsive group. Δ SVV, Δ CI and Δ PVI in responsive group were significantly higher than those in the unresponsive group [ΔSVV: (4.6 ± 1.5)% vs. (1.8 ± 0.9)%, t = 11.187, P = 0.022; ΔCI (mL·s-1.m-2): 18.3 ± 1.7 vs. 1.7 ± 0.5, t = 3.696, P = 0.014; A PVI: (6.4±1.1)% vs. (1.3±0.2)%, t = 19.563, P = 0.013]. No significant correlation between HR, MAP or CVP before PLR and A CI was found. SVV (r = 0.850, P = 0.015) and PVI (r = 0.867, P = 0.001) before PLR were correlated with ΔCI. It was shown by ROC curve that the area under ROC curve (AUC) for SVV fluid responsiveness prediction was 0.948, and cut-off of SVV was 12.4%, the sensitivity was 85.4%, and specificity was 86.6%. The AUC for PVI fluid responsiveness prediction was 0.957, and cut-off was 14.8%, the sensitivity was 87.5%, and specificity was 84.8%. It was higher than other hemodynamic parameters (HR, MAP, CVP). Conclusions: PVI and SVV can better predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilating patients with septic shock after PLR. PVI as a new continuous, noninvasive and functional hemodynamic parameter has the same accuracy as SVV.","Fluid responsiveness; Passive leg raising; Pleth variability index; Septic shock","Area Under Curve; Arterial Pressure; Cardiac Output; Central Venous Pressure; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Plethysmography; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Respiration, Artificial; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity; Shock, Septic; Stroke Volume; Article; artificial ventilation; body fluid; cardiovascular parameters; central venous pressure; clinical evaluation; clinical study; controlled study; fluid flow; fluid resuscitation; heart index; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; major clinical study; mean arterial pressure; passive leg raising; pleth variability index; prediction; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; septic shock; blood volume; China; hemodynamic parameters; measurement accuracy; septic shock; area under the curve; arterial pressure; artificial ventilation; fluid therapy; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; physiologic monitoring; plethysmography; predictive value; Shock, Septic","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84965088783"

Our goal was to determine whether hypotension could be predicted by pulse oximetry parameters, such as the perfusion index and pleth variability index, heart rate, ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency components of heart rate variability, and entropy of heart rate variability, measured before the induction of anaesthesia. The predictive value of these parameters for detecting hypotension was assessed using logistic regression and the grey zone approach in 81 parturients. Logistic regression revealed heart rate to be the only independent predictor (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01-1.13; p = 0.032). The grey zone for heart rate was in the range of 71-89 bpm, and 60.5% of parturients were in the grey zone. Pre-anaesthetic heart rate, but not other parameters derived from pulse oximetry or heart rate variability, may be a prognostic factor for hypotension associated with spinal anaesthesia. © 2015 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland.","","Adult; Anesthesia, Epidural; Anesthesia, Obstetrical; Anesthesia, Spinal; Area Under Curve; Cesarean Section; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypotension; Intraoperative Period; Perfusion; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Young Adult; atropine; bupivacaine; ephedrine; fentanyl; hetastarch; local anesthetic agent; adult; anesthesia induction; Article; blood pressure measurement; cesarean section; diagnostic test accuracy study; entropy of heart rate variability; female; heart index; heart rate; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; hypertension; hypotension; major clinical study; non invasive measurement; observational study; perfusion index; pleth variability index; predictive value; prognosis; prospective study; pulse oximetry; ratio of low frequency to high frequency components of heart rate variability,; spinal anesthesia; systolic blood pressure; area under the curve; epidural anesthesia; hemodynamics; hypotension; intraoperative period; obstetric anesthesia; pathophysiology; perfusion; pregnancy; spinal anesthesia; young adult","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84926966885"

In the current paper, waveforms from non-invasive optical probe that measures carotid artery distension profiles are compared with the waveforms of the pulse pressure acquired by intra-arterial catheter invasive measurement in the ascending aorta. Measurements were performed in a study population of 16 patients who had undergone cardiac catheterization. The hemodynamic parameters: area under the curve (AUC), the area during systole (AS) and the area during diastole (AD), their ratio (AD/AS) and the ejection time index (ETI), from invasive and non-invasive measurements were compared. The results show that the pressure waveforms obtained by the two methods are similar, with 13% of mean value of the root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, the correlation coefficient demonstrates the strong correlation. The comparison between the AUCs allows the assessment of the differences between the phases of the cardiac cycle. In the systolic period the waveforms are almost equal, evidencing greatest clinical relevance during this period. Slight differences are found in diastole, probably due to the structural arterial differences. The optical probe has lower variability than the invasive system (13% vs 16%). This study validates the capability of acquiring the arterial pulse waveform with a non-invasive method, using a non-contact optical probe at the carotid site with residual differences from the aortic invasive measurements. © 2014 IPEM.","Arterial pulse pressure waveform; Cardiac catheterization; Distension profile; Non-invasive measurement; Optical probe; Pulse wave analysis","Aged; Area Under Curve; Blood Pressure; Female; Humans; Male; Optical Devices; Pulsatile Flow; Blood pressure; Blood vessels; Diagnosis; Mean square error; Noninvasive medical procedures; Arterial pulse; Cardiac catheterizations; Distension profile; Non- invasive measurements; Optical probe; Pulse wave analysis; aged; area during diastole; area during systole; artery catheter; artery compliance; artery dilatation; Article; ascending aorta; carotid artery; clinical article; contactless optical probe; female; heart catheterization; heart cycle; heart left ventricle ejection time; hemodynamic parameters; human; intermethod comparison; invasive procedure; male; non invasive measurement; optical instrumentation; pulse pressure; pulse wave; validation study; waveform; area under the curve; blood pressure; pulsatile flow; Probes","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84922519395"

Studies have identified WIA-derived indices that are closely correlated with several disease processes and predictive of functional recovery following myocardial infarction. The cWIA clinical application has, however, been limited by technical challenges including a lack of standardization across different studies and the derived indices' sensitivity to the processing parameters. Specifically, a critical step in WIA is the noise removal for evaluation of derivatives of the acquired signals, typically performed by applying a Savitzky-Golay filter, to reduce the high frequency acquisition noise. Methods: The impact of the filter parameter selection on cWIA output, and on the derived clinical metrics (integral areas and peaks of the major waves), is first analysed. The sensitivity analysis is performed either by using the filter as a differentiator to calculate the signals' time derivative or by applying the filter to smooth the ensemble-averaged waveforms.Furthermore, the power-spectrum of the ensemble-averaged waveforms contains little high-frequency components, which motivated us to propose an alternative approach to compute the time derivatives of the acquired waveforms using a central finite difference scheme. Results and Conclusion: The cWIA output and consequently the derived clinical metrics are significantly affected by the filter parameters, irrespective of its use as a smoothing filter or a differentiator. The proposed approach is parameter-free and, when applied to the 10 in-vivo human datasets and the 50 in-vivo animal datasets, enhances the cWIA robustness by significantly reducing the outcome variability (by 60%). © 2014 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology.","Coronary artery disease; Sensitivity analysis; Wave Intensity Analysis","analysis; article; backward compression wave; backward expansion wave; calculation; carotid artery pulse; central finite difference; coronary artery constriction; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery pressure; coronary flow reserve; finite element analysis; forward compression wave; fractional flow reserve; heart cycle; hemodynamic parameters; human; hyperemic stenosis resistance; in vivo study; nonhuman; priority journal; pulse wave; pulse wave speed; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; savitzky golay filter; sensitivity analysis; signal noise ratio; statistical analysis; wave intensity analysis; waveform; angiocardiography; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cardiovascular disease assessment; clinical article; coronary artery; coronary artery disease; coronary hemodynamics; coronary wave intensity analysis; heart infarction; percutaneous coronary intervention; porcine model","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84905728851"

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between demographic characteristics, autonomic functioning and fatigue levels amongst CFS patients with and without comorbid POTS. Design and setting: All patients presenting to the CFS Discovery Clinic between 2009 and 2012 completed a 20-min standing task as part of their initial assessment. Heart rate and pulse pressure were recorded at baseline, at 2-min intervals poststanding, at the end of the task and following a recovery period. Average heart rate and pulse pressure variability were calculated from this data. Age, gender, length of illness and self-reported fatigue scores were also recorded. POTS patients were diagnosed by an orthostatic increase in heart rate >30 beats per min, concomitant symptoms of orthostatic intolerance and no orthostatic hypotension. Differences in autonomic functioning between POTS and CFS patients were compared using independent samples t-tests, whilst logistic and linear regressions were performed to examine the contribution of autonomic functioning to task completion and perceived fatigue, respectively. Results: Comorbidity of CFS and POTS (CFS-POTS) was observed in 11% (33/306) of patients. CFS-POTS patients were significantly younger (P < 0.001), had a shorter length of illness (P = 0.034), experienced greater task difficulty (P = 0.002) and were able to stand for significantly shorter periods compared to the CFS-only patients (P < 0.001). CFS-POTS patients experienced significantly lower baseline diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.002), significantly higher heart rate and lower pulse pressures at each standing measurement. Early heart rate changes (P = 0.002) and overall heart rate change (P < 0.001) were significant predictors of completion status, whereas heart rate variability (P < 0.001) and female gender (P < 0.001) were significant predictors of increased perceived task difficulty. Conclusions: Haemodynamic and demographic differences between CFS-POTS and CFS-only patients suggest that the former group reflects a distinct subgroup of the CFS population. The findings highlight the utility of screening younger patients with fatigue for POTS, and identified heart rate variability as an important marker of fatigue for CFS patients in general. © 2013 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.","Autonomic function; Chronic fatigue syndrome; Fatigue syndromes; Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; Standing test","Adult; Australia; Blood Pressure; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic; Female; Heart Rate; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome; Posture; Prevalence; Sympathetic Nervous System; autonomic function; chronic fatigue syndrome; fatigue syndromes; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; standing test; adult; article; Australia; autonomic nervous system function; chronic fatigue syndrome; comorbidity; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; disease duration; female; gender; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; priority journal; pulse pressure; systolic blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897027028"

Possibly the most prominent feature is arterial stiffness. Although being an inevitable consequence of aging and inseparable phenomenon with hypertension, it is clear that it predicts cardiovascular risk independently form these two factors. The variability of arterial stiffness is explained by a large range of endocrine, metabolic, haemodynamic, structural and functional properties, that all frequently occur together in chronic kidney disease. Although calcification of the tunica media in the arterial wall, a hallmark of chronic kidney disease, appears difficult to improve, several other components that contribute to arterial stiffness are likely more accessible for modification. Although it is not proven that specifically targeting arterial stiffness translates into improved clinical outcome, this pathological feature of the arterial system is likely neglected clinically and has a sound basis for rational intervention, preferably preceded by interventional trials with clinically important endpoints. In this chapter modifiable and hardly-modifiable factors that likely contribute to arterial stiffness in the setting of chronic kidney disease are addressed. Although areas of uncertainty exist and are underlined, raising awareness of the relevance of this neglected feature of the cardiovascular system, holds the promise of improving the unacceptably high prevalence of complications in chronic kidney disease. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84944214223"

A potential antidote to the cardiotoxic influence of anger is trait forgiveness (TF), as it has shown associations with improved blood pressure (BP) and cardiovagal tone regulation in cardiac patients. However, it has yet to be determined if anger and forgiveness independently predict cardiovascular parameters. Trait anger (State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2) and TF (Tendency to Forgive Scale) were evaluated in 308 (M = 21.11years ± SD = 2.52) healthy female volunteers allocated to 3 related, yet distinct, studies. Hierarchical multiple regressions tested the incremental contribution of TF after accounting for anger. Study 1 assessed autonomic modulation through beat-to-beat BP and spectral analysis to examine sympathovagal balance and baroreflex functioning. Study 2 used tonometry and pulse wave analysis for aortic hemodynamics. Study 3 assessed 24-hour ambulatory BP and ambulatory arterial stiffness index. Hierarchical models demonstrated that anger was significantly associated with increased sympathovagal tone, increased hemodynamic indices, high ambulatory BPs, and attenuated BP variability and baroreflex. In contrast, TF was associated with more favorable hemodynamic effects (i.e., decreased ventricular work and myocardial oxygen consumption). In conclusion, these results demonstrate divergent cardiovascular effects of anger and forgiveness, such that anger is associated with a more cardiotoxic autonomic and hemodynamic profile, whereas TF is associated with a more cardioprotective profile. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at decreasing anger while increasing forgiveness may be clinically relevant. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Whether PVI can be used to assess the changes of intravascular volume status remains to be elucidated. Material/Methods: Using correlation analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we sought a correlation between PVI and the initial distribution volume of glucose (IDVG), evaluating PVI as an indicator of the central extracellular fluid volume after anesthesia induction in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. Results: Strong negative correlations existed between IDVG and PVI (r=-0.72), IDVG, and pulse pressure variation (PPV) (r=-0.73), and between IDVG and systolic pressure variation (SPV) (r=-0.53), P<0.01. Strong positive correlations existed between PPV and PVI (r=0.66), PVI and SPV (r=0.49), and between PPV and SPV (r=0.59), P<0.01. The areas under the ROC curve of IDVG, PVI, and SPV were significantly different from the area under a reference line. The optimal cutoff values (followed by sensitivity and specificity in parentheses) comparable to PPV over 11% as the threshold of hypovolemia were IDVG 94.5 mL/kg (75%, 100%), PVI 13% (91.7%, 77.8%), and SPV 7% (41.7%, 100%). Conclusions: Our results show that strong correlations exist among IDVG, PVI, PPV, and SPV in the evaluation of volemia. PVI can serve as a useful, noninvasive indicator of continuous central extracellular fluid volume for those patients not requiring invasive hemodynamic monitoring, but needs attention to changes in intravascular volume status for optimal fluid management. © Med Sci Monit.","Artificial; Blood circulation; Extracellular fluid; Fluid therapy; Pleth variability index; Respiration","Administration, Intravenous; Anesthesia, General; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Demography; Extracellular Fluid; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Plethysmography; Pulse; Respiration, Artificial; ROC Curve; Surgical Procedures, Elective; Systole; fentanyl; midazolam; phenylephrine; propofol; Ringer lactate solution; sevoflurane; suxamethonium; vasoactive agent; vecuronium; abdominal surgery; adult; aged; anesthesia induction; anesthetic equipment; area under the curve; article; clinical article; diagnostic test accuracy study; extracellular space; female; hematological parameters; human; initial distribution volume of glucose; male; pleth variability index; pulse pressure; sensitivity and specificity; systolic blood pressure; ventilated patient","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84897852619"

The aim of the present study was to verify whether harmonic indexes of the arterial blood pressure waveform (BPWs) can be used to discriminate between PCOS patients and healthy individuals. METHODS: Twenty-minute bilateral radial BPW signals were obtained in 20 PCOS patients and 20 healthy individuals. Amplitude proportions (Cn values) and their coefficients of variation (CVn values) were calculated for harmonics 1-10 of the BPW. RESULTS: C1 was significantly larger whereas C4, CV2, and CV6 were significantly smaller in PCOS patients compared with healthy individuals. DISCUSSION: The results of the present study suggest that harmonic-analysis indexes of the BPWs could provide information about the arterial pulse transmission (by monitoring Cn) and cardiovascular regulatory activities (by monitoring CVn). These findings could aid the development of an easy-to-perform, noninvasive, and continuous monitoring technique to improve the detection of PCOS-induced hemodynamic changes.

Crest time, normalized crest time, crest time ratio (CTR), small- and large-scale MSE on CT [MSESS(CT) and MSELS(CT), respectively] were computed and correlated with anthropometric (i.e., body weight/height, waist circumference), hemodynamic (i.e., blood pressure), and biochemical parameters (i.e., serum triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, fasting blood sugar, and glycosylated hemoglobin). The results demonstrated higher variability in CT in healthy subjects (Groups 1 and 2) compared with that in diabetic patients (Group 3) as reflected in significantly elevated MSESS(CT) and MSELS(CT) in the former (p < 0.003 and p < 0.001, respectively). MSELS(CT) also showed significant association with waist circumference and fasting blood sugar (i.e., two diagnostic criteria of metabolic syndrome) as well as glycosylated hemoglobin concentration. In conclusion, using MSE analysis for assessing CT variation successfully distinguished diabetic patients from healthy subjects. MSESS(CT) and MSELS(CT) therefore may serve as noninvasive tools for identifying subjects with diabetes and those at risk. © 2014, International Federation for Medical and Biological Engineering.","Crest time; Crest time ratio; Diabetes; Digital volume pulse; Normalized crest time","Adult; Arteries; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Entropy; Health; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Wavelet Analysis; Young Adult; Anthropometry; Blood; Blood pressure; Entropy; Glycoproteins; Hemoglobin; Medical problems; Scales (weighing instruments); glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein; triacylglycerol; Biochemical parameters; Crest time; Digital volume pulse; Glycosylated hemoglobins; High density lipoprotein; Normalized crest time; Time ratio; Waveform contour analysis; adult; anthropometry; Article; association; blood vessel parameters; body weight; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; crest time; diabetic patient; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; entropy; female; glucose blood level; human; laboratory; major clinical study; male; multiscale entropy; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; photoelectric plethysmography; priority journal; pulse pressure; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; waist circumference; waveform; artery; case control study; diabetes mellitus; health; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; pathophysiology; time; wavelet analysis; young adult; Diagnosis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84925488460"

Methods: Totally 60 patients undergoing cervical vertebra operation or lumbar vertebra operation were studied. All patients were also monitored with Vigileo/FloTrac system. The functional hemodynamic parameters including stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and pleth variability index (PVI) under PEEP levels of 0 mmHg, 5 mmHg, 10 mmHg, and 15 mmHg were recorded before and after volume expansion (hydroxyethyl starch 6%, 7 ml/kg). Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in stroke volume index (SVI) ≥15% (Δ SVI ≥15%). Responders were defined as patients demonstrating an increase in SVI3= 15% after intravascular volume expansion and non-responders as patients whose SVI changed < 15%. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for SVV, PPV, and PVI under different PEEP levels to determine their diagnosis accuracies and thresholds and their potential correlations. Results: In the prone position, SVV, PPV, and PVI were significantly higher compared to those in the supine position (P < 0. 05) and the mean arterial pressure significantly decreased (P < 0. 05); however, the changes of heart rate, stroke volume, SVI, cardiac output, and cardiac index showed no significant difference (P > 0. 05).In the prone position, along with the elevation of PEEP (0 mmHg, 5 mmHg, 10 mmHg, and 15 mmHg), the areas under the ROC curves of SVV were 0. 864, 0. 759, 0. 718, and 0. 521, the area under the ROC of PPV were 0. 873, 0.792, 0.705, and 0.505, and the area under the ROC of PVI were 0.851, 0.765, 0.709, and 0. 512. Under PEEP =0 mmHg, the diagnostic thresholds of SVV, PPV, and PVI were 10.5, 11.5, and 13. 5. Under PEEP =5 mmHg, the diagnostic thresholds of SVV, PPV, and PVI were 11.5, 13.5, and 14. 5. Under PEEP = 10 mmHg, the diagnostic thresholds of SVV, PPV, and PVI were 13.5, 14.5, and 16.5. In the prone position, there was a significant correlation between SVV, PPV, PVI, and PEEP. Conclusions: SVV, PPV and PVI can predict fluid responsiveness similarly under the PEEP levels of 0, 5, and 10 mmHg. Their diagnostic thresholds increases with the PEEP and the diagnostic accuracies decrease with the PEEP. However, under the PEEP level of 15 mmHg, SVV, PPV, and PVI can not predict fluid responsiveness accurately.","Pleth variability index; Pluse pressure variation; Positive end expiratory pressure; Prone position; Stroke volume variation","Anesthesia, General; Blood Pressure; Cardiac Output; Hemodynamics; Humans; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Prone Position; ROC Curve; Stroke; Stroke Volume; Article; body posture; general anesthesia; heart index; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; hemodynamic parameters; human; major clinical study; pleth variability index; positive end expiratory pressure; pulse pressure variation; receiver operating characteristic; spine surgery; stroke volume variation; blood pressure; cerebrovascular accident; hemodynamics; positive end expiratory pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930836002"

Recent Findings: Fluid responsiveness can be predicted during positive pressure breathing by variations in venous return or left ventricular output using numerous surrogate markers, such as arterial pulse pressure variation (PPV), left ventricular stroke volume variation (SVV), aortic velocity variation, inferior and superior vena cavae diameter changes and pulse oximeter pleth signal variability. Similarly, dynamic changes in cardiac output to a passive leg raising manoeuvre can be used in any patient and measured invasively or noninvasively. However, volume responsiveness, though important, reflects only part of the overall spectrum of functional physiological variables that can be measured to define physiologic state and monitor response to therapy. The ratio of PPV to SVV defines central arterial elastance and can be used to identify those hypotensive patients who will not increase their blood pressure in response to a fluid challenge despite increasing cardiac output. Dynamic tissue O2 saturation (StO2) responses to complete stop flow conditions, as can be created by measuring hand StO2 and occluding flow with a blood pressure cuff, assesses cardiovascular sufficiency and micro-circulatory blood flow distribution. They can be used to identify those ventilator-dependent individuals who will fail a spontaneous breathing trial or trauma patients in need of life-saving interventions. Summary: Functional haemodynamic monitoring approaches are increasing in numbers, conditions in which they are useful and resuscitation protocol applications.

Further, haemodynamic management of patients immediately after surgery for aortic stenosis can be challenging. Prediction of fluid responsiveness using dynamic variables has not been sufficiently studied in patients for aortic stenosis surgery. Methods Observational study evaluating fluid responsiveness on 32 (31 analysed) patients scheduled for aortic valve replacement due to aortic stenosis on mechanical ventilation before and after valve replacement. Increase in stroke volume (oesophagus Doppler) ≥15% to a fluid challenge defined fluid responders. Results Before surgery (31 fluid loads performed in 31 patients), areas under receiver operating characteristics curves (95% confidence intervals) were stroke volume variation (from arterial pulse contour analysis) 0.77 (0.58-0.90), pulse pressure variation 0.75 (0.54-0.90) and Pleth variability index 0.51 (0.31-0.69). After aortic valve replacement (31 fluid loads performed in 23 patients) the values were stroke volume variation 0.90 (0.74-0.98), pulse pressure variation 0.95 (0.80-1.0) and Pleth variability index 0.72 (0.52-0.87). Conclusions The arterial pressure-based variables had moderate predictive values before valve replacement, but it predicted fluid responsiveness well postoperatively. Pleth variability index did not predict fluid responsiveness preoperatively, and it had a moderate predictive value postoperatively. These results indicate that arterial pressure-based dynamic variables have limited potential to guide fluid therapy in patients with aortic stenosis. Their ability to guide fluid therapy after aortic valve replacement seems better. © 2014 The Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica Foundation.

The current editions of major textbooks in the primary specialties - in which clinicians routinely encounter patients in shock - including surgery, anesthesia, emergency medicine, and internal medicine continue to incorporate traditional (conventional) descriptions of shock that use well-described (but potentially misleading) intravascular pressures to classify shock states. Reliance on such intravascular pressure measurements is not as helpful as newer ""dynamic"" functional measures including ultrasonography to both better assess volume responsiveness and biventricular cardiac function.

Twenty-eight obese postmenopausal women (57±1 years) were randomized to a ST (n=14) or no-exercise control (CON) group (n=14). ST included stretching exercises 3 days week-1 for 8 weeks. Brachial (b) and aortic (a) systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), carotid-femoral PWV (aPWV), femoral-ankle PWV (faPWV), AIx, low-frequency component of SBP (LFSBP) and sit/reach score (SRS) were measured before and after interventions. There were significant decreases in bSBP (P<0.05), aSBP (P<0.01), aDBP (P<0.05), aMAP (P<0.01), aAIx (P<0.05) and LFSBP (P<0.05) after ST compared with CON. SRS significantly (P<0.01) increased after ST but not after CON. There were no significant effects (P>0.05) on HR, baPWV, aPWV and faPWV after ST or CON. Eight weeks of ST decreases BP, AIx and LFSBP in obese postmenopausal women.

The effect of ST36 acupuncture treatment on the hyperventilation-induced CO2 reactivity of the basilar and middle cerebral arteries was studied in 10 healthy male volunteers (mean age, 25.2 ± 1.5 years) using a transcranial Doppler sonography with an interval of 1 week between measurements, and a portable ECG monitoring system was used to obtain ECG data simultaneously. The CO2 reactivity of the basilar and middle cerebral arteries increased significantly after ST36 acupuncture treatment, whereas the mean arterial blood pressure and pulse rate did not change significantly. The high-frequency power significantly increased after ST36 acupuncture treatment, and the percentage increase of high-frequency power correlated significantly with the percentage increase in the CO2 reactivity of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. These data suggest that ST36 acupuncture treatment increases CO2 reactivity, indicating improvement of vasodilatory potential of the cerebral vasculature to compensate for fluctuations caused by changes in external conditions. The increase in parasympathetic tone by ST36 acupuncture treatment is responsible for this therapeutic effect. © 2014 Sang-Ho Hyun et al.","","stainless steel; acupuncture; acupuncture needle; adult; arterial carbon dioxide tension; Article; basilar artery; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; Doppler echography; electrocardiography monitoring; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; hyperventilation; hypocapnia; male; mean arterial pressure; middle cerebral artery; normal human; parasympathetic tone; priority journal; pulse rate; therapy effect","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84934967490"

We noticed two forms of circulatory response to orthostatic stress in POTS. We investigated cardiovascular and autonomic nervous response to orthostatic stress in the two forms. Methods We studied 79 patients with POTS and 38 healthy control subjects (Ct). Beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were non-invasively and continuously measured in the supine and standing positions. Autonomic nervous function was evaluated on power spectral analysis of HR variability and diastolic BP variability. We divided the subjects into two groups: standing-induced tachycardia (SI group; increase in HR ≥35 beats/min) and supine tachycardia (Su group; standing HR ≥115 beats/min with standing-induced HR increase <35 beats/min). Results The Su group had higher supine BP and HR compared with the other groups, indicating dominant sympathetic control of the heart in the supine position. While rising, the SI group had a higher increase in HR than the Ct group, indicating excessive withdrawal of vagal tone. The Su group had a smaller increase in HR and a greater decrease of systolic BP and cardiac index by standing compared with the SI group. These results suggest that compensatory mechanisms of sympathetic function during standing failed in the Su group, probably because of exhaustion by the nearly maximum effort to generate sympathetic drive even in the supine position with low central blood volume. Conclusion There is a difference between the two types of POTS, in the balance of resting autonomic function and hemodynamic response to standing. © 2014 Japan Pediatric Society.","continuous tachycardia; standing-induced tachycardia","Adolescent; Autonomic Nervous System; Child; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Male; Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome; Posture; adolescent; article; autonomic nervous system function; child; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; heart index; heart rate variability; human; major clinical study; male; mental arithmetic; orthostatic stress; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome; priority journal; pulse pressure; standing; supine position; vagus tone; autonomic nervous system; body posture; hemodynamics; pathophysiology; physiology; postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84901848470"

Methods: Twenty-six patients with stomach cancer receiving laparoscopy-assisted radical gastrectomy under general anesthesia were involved in this study. The indexes of SVV, PPV and PVI were monitored continuously after general anesthesia. A volume loading test was performed after pneumoperitoneum, and the hemodynamic parameters were determined before and after fluid infusion (6% HES, 7ml/kg), and the patients were divided into response group (n=16) and non-response group (n=10) according to whether the increase in stroke volume index (ΔSVI) was ≥15% or not.

This study sought to examine the impact of central hypovolemia on peripheral venous pressure (PVP) waveforms in spontaneously breathing subjects. With IRB approval, 11 healthy subjects underwent progressive LBNP (baseline,-30,-75, and -90 mmHg or until the subject became symptomatic). Each was monitored for heart rate (HR), finger arterial blood pressure (BP), a chest respiratory band and PVP waveforms which are generated from a transduced upper extremity intravenous site. The first subject was excluded from PVP analysis because of technical errors in collecting the venous pressure waveform. PVP waveforms were analyzed to determine venous pulse pressure, mean venous pressure, pulse width, maximum and minimum slope (time domain analysis) together with cardiac and respiratory modulations (frequency domain analysis). No changes of significance were found in the arterial BP values at -30 mmHg LBNP, while there were significant reductions in the PVP waveforms time domain parameters (except for 50% width of the respiration induced modulations) together with modulation of the PVP waveform at the cardiac frequency but not at the respiratory frequency. As the LBNP progressed, arterial systolic BP, mean BP and pulse pressure, PVP parameters and PVP cardiac modulation decreased significantly, while diastolic BP and HR increased significantly. Changes in hemodynamic and PVP waveform parameters reached a maximum during the symptomatic phase. During the recovery phase, there was a significant reduction in HR together with a significant increase in HR variability, mean PVP and PVP cardiac modulation. Thus, in response to mild hypovolemia induced by LBNP, changes in cardiac modulation and other PVP waveform parameters identified hypovolemia before detectable hemodynamic changes. © 2014 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","clinical monitoring; low body negative pressure; venous waveform","Blood Pressure; Fingers; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Rate; Humans; Hypovolemia; Lower Body Negative Pressure; Respiration; Time Factors; Venous Pressure; Frequency domain analysis; Heart; Hemodynamics; Mercury compounds; Modulation; Time domain analysis; Clinical monitoring; Hypovolemia; Low body negative pressure; Lower body; Negative pressures; Pressure waveforms; Venoi waveform; Venous pressure; Waveform parameters; Waveforms; article; blood pressure; breathing; finger; heart rate; human; hypovolemia; lower body negative pressure; normal human; pathophysiology; time; vascularization; venous pressure; Blood pressure","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84902689564"
